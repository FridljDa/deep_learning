Here, we review how this experimental design has realized its promise by facilitating an impressive range of discoveries with remarkable impact on multiple fields, including population genetics, complex trait genetics, epidemiology, social science, and medicine. We predict that the emergence of large-scale biobanks will continue to expand to more diverse populations and capture more of the allele frequency spectrum through whole-genome sequencing, which will further improve our ability to investigate the causes and consequences of human genetic variation for complex traits and diseases.},

This study tested the salmon bias hypothesis that Latinos engage in return migration to their country of origin and are thereby rendered "statistically immortal" and the alternative hypothesis that selection of healthier migrants to the United States accounts for the paradox. METHODS: National Longitudinal Mortality Study data were used to examine mortality rates of the following groups for whom the salmon hypothesis is not feasible: Cubans, who face barriers against return migration; Puerto Ricans, whose deaths in Puerto Rico are recorded in US national statistics; and US-born individuals, who are not subject to either salmon or healthy migrant effects. RESULTS: The sample included 301,718 non-Latino Whites and 17,375 Latino Whites 25 years or older. Cubans and Puerto Ricans had lower mortality than non-Latino Whites. Moreover, US-born Latinos had lower mortality than US-born non-Latino Whites. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the salmon nor the healthy migrant hypothesis explains the pattern of findings. Other factors must be operating to produce the lower mortality.}

  abstract = {There have been over 100 years of literature discussing the deleterious influence of racism on health. Much of the literature describes racism as a driver of social determinants of health, such as housing, employment, income, and education. More recently, increased attention has been given to measuring the structural nature of a system that advantages one racialized group over others rather than solely relying on individual acknowledgement of racism. Despite these advances, there is still a need for methodological and analytical approaches to complement the aforementioned. This commentary calls on epidemiologists and other health researchers at large to engage the discourse on measuring structural racism. First, we address the conflation between race and racism in epidemiologic research. Next, we offer methodological recommendations (linking of interdisciplinary variables and data sets and leveraging mixed-method and life-course approaches) and analytical recommendations (integration of mixed data, use of multidimensional models) that epidemiologists and other health researchers may consider in health equity research. The goal of this commentary is to inspire the use of up-to-date and theoretically driven approaches to increase discourse among public health researchers on capturing racism as well as to improve evidence of its role as the fundamental cause of racial health inequities.},

  abstract = {Understanding functional effects of genetic variants is one of the key challenges in human genetics, as much of disease-associated variation is located in non-coding regions with typically unknown putative gene regulatory effects. One of the most important approaches in this field has been molecular quantitative trait locus (molQTL) mapping, where genetic variation is associated with molecular traits that can be measured at scale, such as gene expression, splicing and chromatin accessibility. The maturity of the field and large-scale studies have produced a rich set of established methods for molQTL analysis, with novel technologies opening up new areas of discovery. In this Primer, we discuss the study design, input data and statistical methods for molQTL mapping and outline the properties of the resulting data as well as popular downstream applications. We review both the limitations and caveats of molQTL mapping as well as future potential approaches to tackle them. With technological development now providing many complementary methods for functional characterization of genetic variants, we anticipate that molQTLs will remain an important part of this toolkit as the only existing approach that can measure human variation in its native genomic, cellular and tissue context.},

Recent toxicological studies suggest that wildfire particulate matter may be more toxic than equal doses of ambient PM2.5. Air quality regulations however assume that the toxicity of PM2.5 does not vary across different sources of emission. Assessing whether PM2.5 from wildfires is more or less harmful than PM2.5 from other sources is a pressing public health concern. Here, we isolate the wildfire-specific PM2.5 using a series of statistical approaches and exposure definitions. We found increases in respiratory hospitalizations ranging from 1.3 to up to 10\% with a 10\,{$\mu$}g\,m-3 increase in wildfire-specific PM2.5, compared to 0.67 to 1.3\% associated with non-wildfire PM2.5. Our conclusions point to the need for air quality policies to consider the variability in PM2.5 impacts on human health according to the sources of emission.},

A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe three transformations (based on the delta method, model residuals, or inferred latent expression state) and compare their strengths and weaknesses. We find that although the residuals and latent expression state-based models have appealing theoretical properties, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data the simple shifted logarithm in combination with principal component analysis performs surprisingly well.},

Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/M{$\Sigma$}i=1M ziT Azi, where the zi are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1/M{$\Sigma$}i=1M ziT Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute zTAz given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-{$\delta$}, the relative error in the estimate is at most {$\epsilon$}. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best. We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},

We then turn to the potential causal mechanisms behind the observed correlations. Given its focus on causal econometric models, we argue that economics has a comparative advantage in evaluating these mechanisms. We consider (a) profit-maximizing decisions by firms, (b) Tiebout-like utility-maximizing decisions by households in the presence of income disparities, (c) Coasean negotiations between both sides, (d) political economy explanations and governmental failures, and (e) intergenerational transmission of poverty.

At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR)\textemdash the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries\textemdash is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap\textemdash their construction does not require any new data\textemdash and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.},

We performed a meta-analysis of estimated mortality associations by age and sex.

Meta-analysis showed a statistically higher risk of death of 0.64\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 0.78) for older populations compared with 0.34\% (95\% CI: 0.25, 0.42) for younger populations per 10 {$\mu$}g/m3 increase of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}10 {$\mu$}m. Women had a slightly higher risk of death of 0.55\% (95\% CI: 0.41, 0.70) compared with 0.50\% (95\% CI: 0.34, 0.54) for men, but these 2 risks were not statistically different. Our synthesis on modifiers for risks associated with particulate matter can aid the design of air quality policies and suggest directions for future research.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

In this commentary, we describe the current state of thinking about the interpretation of R/E variables in etiologic studies. We then discuss how such variables are commonly used in environmental epidemiology. We observed three main uses for R/E: i) as a confounder, ii) as an effect measure modifier and iii) as the main exposure of interest either through descriptive analysis or under a causal framework. We identified some common methodological concerns in each case and provided some practical solutions. The use of R/E in observational studies requires particular cautions in terms of formal interpretation and this commentary aims at providing a practical resource for future studies assessing racial/ethnic health disparities in environmental research.},

  abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution is about intelligence and not physical energy. Indeed, artificial intelligence (AI) is already disrupting our society and world in many domains. Notably, it could be beneficial for medicine and healthcare globally. Indeed, Newman-Toker, in the Journal of the Medical Association, asserted that more than 40,000 patients die each year in the US intensive care units (ICU) because of misdiagnosis. But how could Machine Learning help in overcoming this issue? Machine Learning has become influential in detecting liver masses, shown great promise in oncology, and drastically changed orthodontics. In 2017, Esteva and Colleagues developed a deep neural network that could differentiate benign and malignant skin lesions better than most certified dermatologists. The applications of ML in medicine are various and provide exceptional results to compete with the most expert physicians in terms of diagnosis. Indeed, when a radiologist interprets thousands of medical images in his career, a Machine Learning algorithm trains on billions of images in a short amount of time to test it on new data and make the perfect diagnosis. More broadly, AI has thus deeply affected medicine and healthcare for the better, not only in terms of diagnosis but in multiple other ways. However, many of these new technologies are controversial and need to be adequately integrated. Even though ML's progress is tremendous, robots can't replace doctors. A perfect symbiosis between healthcare providers and technology could help develop these techniques.},

The false discovery rate (FDR) is one of the most commonly used approaches for measuring and controlling error rates when performing multiple tests. Adaptive FDRs rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here, we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini\textendash Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in FDR estimator. We apply our method to a genome-wise association meta-analysis for body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios. We provide an implementation of this novel method for estimating the proportion of null hypotheses in a regression framework as part of the Bioconductor package swfdr.},

In this work, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and differential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional loss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that saddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in lower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. In such projections, the expected curvature in a lower-dimensional representation is proportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean curvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on average, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the connection between expected curvature and mean curvature (i.e., the normalized Hessian trace) to estimate the trace of Hessians without calculating the Hessian or Hessian-vector products as in Hutchinson's method. Because random projections are not able to correctly identify saddle information, we propose to study projections along Hessian directions that are associated with the largest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the ongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability. Finally, we illustrate our method in numerical experiments on different image classifiers with up to about 7 \texttimes{} 106 parameters.},

A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries.

  abstract = {Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution is associated with increased risk of several causes of death. However, epidemiologic evidence suggests that current knowledge does not comprehensively capture all causes of death associated with PM2.5 exposure.To systematically identify causes of death associated with PM2.5 pollution and estimate the burden of death for each cause in the United States.In a cohort study of US veterans followed up between 2006 and 2016, ensemble modeling was used to identify and characterize morphology of the association between PM2.5 and causes of death. Burden of death associated with PM2.5 exposure in the contiguous United States and for each state was then estimated by application of estimated risk functions to county-level PM2.5 estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency and cause-specific death rate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Nonlinear exposure-response functions of the association between PM2.5 and causes of death and burden of death associated with PM2.5.Annual mean PM2.5 levels.A cohort of 4\,522\,160 US veterans (4\,243\,462 [93.8\%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 64.1 [55.7-75.5] years; 3\,702\,942 [82.0\%] white, 667\,550 [14.8\%] black, and 145\,593 [3.2\%] other race) was followed up for a median (interquartile range) of 10.0 (6.8-10.2) years. In the contiguous United States, PM2.5 exposure was associated with excess burden of death due to cardiovascular disease (56\,070.1 deaths [95\% uncertainty interval \{UI\}, 51\,940.2-60\,318.3 deaths]), cerebrovascular disease (40\,466.1 deaths [95\% UI, 21\,770.1-46\,487.9 deaths]), chronic kidney disease (7175.2 deaths [95\% UI, 5910.2-8371.9 deaths]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (645.7 deaths [95\% UI, 300.2-2490.9 deaths]), dementia (19\,851.5 deaths [95\% UI, 14\,420.6-31\,621.4 deaths]), type 2 diabetes (501.3 deaths [95\% UI, 447.5-561.1 deaths]), hypertension (30\,696.9 deaths [95\% UI, 27\,518.1-33\,881.9 deaths]), lung cancer (17\,545.3 deaths [95\% UI, 15\,055.3-20\,464.5 deaths]), and pneumonia (8854.9 deaths [95\% UI, 7696.2-10\,710.6 deaths]). Burden exhibited substantial geographic variation. Estimated burden of death due to nonaccidental causes was 197\,905.1 deaths (95\% UI, 183\,463.3-213\,644.9 deaths); mean age-standardized death rates (per 100\,000) due to nonaccidental causes were higher among black individuals (55.2 [95\% UI, 50.5-60.6]) than nonblack individuals (51.0 [95\% UI, 46.4-56.1]) and higher among those living in counties with high (65.3 [95\% UI, 56.2-75.4]) vs low (46.1 [95\% UI, 42.3-50.4]) socioeconomic deprivation; 99.0\% of the burden of death due to nonaccidental causes was associated with PM2.5 levels below standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency.In this study, 9 causes of death were associated with PM2.5 exposure. The burden of death associated with PM2.5 was disproportionally borne by black individuals and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Effort toward cleaner air might reduce the burden of PM2.5-associated deaths.}

Questions remain regarding whether improvements in air quality are equitably distributed across subpopulations. We assess spatial variability and temporal trends in concentrations of particulate matter {$<$}2.5{$\mu$}m (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) across North Carolina (NC) from 2002-2016, and associations with community characteristics. Estimated daily PM2.5 and O3 concentrations at 2010 Census tracts were obtained from the Fused Air Quality Surface using Downscaling archive and averaged to create tract-level annual PM2.5 and O3 estimates. We calculated tract-level racial isolation (RI) of non-Hispanic Blacks; educational isolation (EI) of non-college educated individuals; the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI); and percentage of the population in urban areas. We fit hierarchical Bayesian space-time models to estimate baseline concentrations of and time trends in PM2.5 and O3 for each tract, accounting for spatial between-tract correlation. Concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 declined by 6.4{$\mu$}g/m3 and 13.5ppb, respectively. Tracts with lower EI and higher urbanicity had higher PM2.5, and more pronounced declines in PM2.5. RI was associated with higher PM2.5, but not with the rate of decline in PM2.5. Despite declines in pollutant concentrations, over time, disparities in exposure increased for racially and educationally isolated communities.},

It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

Here we bring together data on the changing risk and societal burden of wildfire in the United States. We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland\textendash urban interface in the United States, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 y. To illustrate how changes in wildfire activity might affect air pollution and related health outcomes, and how these linkages might guide future science and policy, we develop a statistical model that relates satellite-based fire and smoke data to information from pollution monitoring stations. Using the model, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25\% of PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter {$<$}2.5 {$\mu$}m) in recent years across the United States, and up to half in some Western regions, with spatial patterns in ambient smoke exposure that do not follow traditional socioeconomic pollution exposure gradients. We combine the model with stylized scenarios to show that fuel management interventions could have large health benefits and that future health impacts from climate-change\textendash induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change\textemdash but that both estimates remain uncertain. We use model results to highlight important areas for future research and to draw lessons for policy.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major global health concern. Quantitative estimates of attributable mortality are based on disease-specific hazard ratio models that incorporate risk information from multiple PM2.5 sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from use of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking), requiring assumptions about equivalent exposure and toxicity. We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a PM2.5-mortality hazard ratio function based only on cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range. We modeled the shape of the association between PM2.5 and nonaccidental mortality using data from 41 cohorts from 16 countries-the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We then constructed GEMMs for five specific causes of death examined by the global burden of disease (GBD). The GEMM predicts 8.9 million [95\% confidence interval (CI): 7.5-10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure 30\% larger than that predicted by the sum of deaths among the five specific causes (6.9; 95\% CI: 4.9-8.5) and 120\% larger than the risk function used in the GBD (4.0; 95\% CI: 3.3-4.8). Differences between the GEMM and GBD risk functions are larger for a 20\% reduction in concentrations, with the GEMM predicting 220\% higher excess deaths. These results suggest that PM2.5 exposure may be related to additional causes of death than the five considered by the GBD and that incorporation of risk information from other, nonoutdoor, particle sources leads to underestimation of disease burden, especially at higher concentrations.},

  abstract = {Assessing the significance of multiple and dependent comparisons is an important, and often ignored, issue that becomes more critical as the size of data sets increases. If not accounted for, false-positive differences are very likely to be identified. The need to address this issue has led to the development of a myriad of procedures to account for multiple testing. The simplest and most widely used technique is the Bonferroni method, which controls the probability that a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. However, it is a very conservative procedure. As a result, the larger the data set the greater the chances that truly significant differences will be missed. In 1995, a new criterion, the false discovery rate (FDR), was proposed to control the proportion of false declarations of significance among those individual deviations from null hypotheses considered to be significant. It is more powerful than all previously proposed methods. Multiple and dependent comparisons are also fundamental in spatial analysis. As the number of locations increases, assessing the significance of local statistics of spatial association becomes a complex matter. In this article we use empirical and simulated data to evaluate the use of the FDR approach in appraising the occurrence of clusters detected by local indicators of spatial association. Results show a significant gain in identification of meaningful clusters when controlling the FDR, in comparison to more conservative approaches. When no control is adopted, false clusters are likely to be identified. If a conservative approach is used, clusters are only partially identified and true clusters are largely missed. In contrast, when the FDR approach is adopted, clusters are fully identified. Incorporating a correction for spatial dependence to conservative methods improves the results, but not enough to match those obtained by the FDR approach.},

Algorithms for this task are based on the idea that the dimensionality of many data sets is only artificially high; though each data point consists of perhaps thousands of features, it may be described as a function of only a few underlying parameters. That is, the data points are actually samples from a low-dimensional manifold that is embedded in a high-dimensional space. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to uncover these parameters in order to find a low-dimensional representation of the data. In this paper, we discuss the motivation, background, and algorithms proposed for manifold learning. Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Semidefinite Embedding, and a host of variants of these algorithms are examined.},

This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the FDR. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating FDRs and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an ``informative variable'', is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The FDR is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first application is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine a large number of markers across the genome to identify associations between genetic variants and disease. Most published studies examine only single markers, which may be less informative than considering multiple markers and multiple genes jointly because genes may interact with each other to affect disease risk. Much knowledge has been accumulated in the literature on biological pathways and interactions. It is conceivable that appropriate incorporation of such prior knowledge may improve the likelihood of making genuine discoveries. Although a number of methods have been developed recently to prioritize genes using prior biological knowledge, such as pathways, most methods treat genes in a specific pathway as an exchangeable set without considering the topological structure of a pathway. However, how genes are related with each other in a pathway may be very informative to identify association signals. To make use of the connectivity information among genes in a pathway in GWAS analysis, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to incorporate pathway topology for association analysis. We show that the conditional distribution of our MRF model takes on a simple logistic regression form, and we propose an iterated conditional modes algorithm as well as a decision theoretic approach for statistical inference of each gene's association with disease. Simulation studies show that our proposed framework is more effective to identify genes associated with disease than a single gene\textendash based method. We also illustrate the usefulness of our approach through its applications to a real data example.},

Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for source-specific PM2.5 identified through a source apportionment analysis. Exposure to 2010 annual average concentrations of source-specific PM2.5 components was assessed at baseline residential addresses. The source apportionment resulted in the identification of five sources: traffic, residual oil combustion, soil, biomass and agriculture, and industry. In single-source analysis, all identified sources were significantly positively associated with increased natural mortality risks. In multisource analysis, associations with all sources attenuated but remained statistically significant with traffic, oil, and biomass and agriculture. The highest association per interquartile increase was observed for the traffic component (HR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 1.04 and 1.08 per 2.86 {$\mu$}g/m3 increase) across five identified sources. On a 1 {$\mu$}g/m3 basis, the residual oil-related PM2.5 had the strongest association (HR: 1.13; 95\% CI: 1.05 and 1.22), which was substantially higher than that for generic PM2.5 mass, suggesting that past estimates using the generic PM2.5 exposure response function have underestimated the potential clean air health benefits of reducing fossil-fuel combustion. Source-specific associations with cause-specific mortality were in general consistent with findings of natural mortality.}

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

  abstract = {Background Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2{$\cdot$}5) is associated with increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality, and health risks differ by the chemical composition of PM2{$\cdot$}5. Policies to control PM2{$\cdot$}5 could change its chemical composition and total mass concentration, leading to change in the subsequent health impact. However, there is little ence on whether associations between PM2{$\cdot$}5 and health exhibit temporal variation. We investigated whether risks of hospitalisations from short-term exposure to PM2{$\cdot$}5 varied over time in the USA. Methods We did a time-series analysis using a national dataset comprising daily circulatory and respiratory hospitalisation rates of Medicare beneficiaries (age {$\geq$}65 years) and PM2{$\cdot$}5 in 173 US counties from 1999 to 2016. We fitted modified quasi-Poisson models to estimate temporal trends of associations within a county, and pooled county-level estimates using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to generate an overall estimate. Findings The study included 10,559,654 circulatory and 3,027,281 respiratory hospitalisations. We identified changes in the national average association between previous-day PM2{$\cdot$}5 and respiratory hospitalisation over time, with a U-shape that is robust under stratification, linear, and non-linear models. The change in risk of respiratory hospitalisation per 10 {$\mu$}g/m3 increase in previous-day PM2{$\cdot$}5 decreased from 0{$\cdot$}75\% (95\% posterior credible interval 0{$\cdot$}05 to 1{$\cdot$}46) in 1999 to \textendash 0{$\cdot$}28\% (\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79 to 0{$\cdot$}23) in 2008, and then increased to 1{$\cdot$}44\% (0{$\cdot$}00 to 2{$\cdot$}91) in 2016. No statistically significant temporal change was observed for associations between same-day PM2{$\cdot$}5 and circulatory hospitalisation. Interpretation Hospitalisation risk from PM2{$\cdot$}5 changes over time and has increased over the past 7 years in study, especially in northeastern USA. The temporal trend differs by cause of hospitalisation. This study emphasises the necessity of evaluating temporal heterogeneity in health impacts of PM2{$\cdot$}5 and suggests caution in applying association estimates to a different time period.

  abstract = {Results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have shown that complex diseases are often affected by many genetic variants with small or moderate effects. Identifications of these risk variants remain a very challenging problem. There is a need to develop more powerful statistical methods to leverage available information to improve upon traditional approaches that focus on a single GWAS dataset without incorporating additional data. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical approach, GPA (Genetic analysis incorporating Pleiotropy and Annotation), to increase statistical power to identify risk variants through joint analysis of multiple GWAS data sets and annotation information because: (1) accumulating evidence suggests that different complex diseases share common risk bases, i.e., pleiotropy; and (2) functionally annotated variants have been consistently demonstrated to be enriched among GWAS hits. GPA can integrate multiple GWAS datasets and functional annotations to seek association signals, and it can also perform hypothesis testing to test the presence of pleiotropy and enrichment of functional annotation. Statistical inference of the model parameters and SNP ranking is achieved through an EM algorithm that can handle genome-wide markers efficiently. When we applied GPA to jointly analyze five psychiatric disorders with annotation information, not only did GPA identify many weak signals missed by the traditional single phenotype analysis, but it also revealed relationships in the genetic architecture of these disorders. Using our hypothesis testing framework, statistically significant pleiotropic effects were detected among these psychiatric disorders, and the markers annotated in the central nervous system genes and eQTLs from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database were significantly enriched. We also applied GPA to a bladder cancer GWAS data set with the ENCODE DNase-seq data from 125 cell lines. GPA was able to detect cell lines that are biologically more relevant to bladder cancer. The R implementation of GPA is currently available at http://dongjunchung.github.io/GPA/.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disparities in exposure to air pollution by race-ethnicity and by socioeconomic status have been documented in the United States, but the impacts of declining transportation-related air pollutant emissions on disparities in exposure have not been studied in detail. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to estimate changes over time (2000 to 2010) in disparities in exposure to outdoor concentrations of a transportation-related air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in the United States. METHODS: We combined annual average NO2 concentration estimates from a temporal land use regression model with Census demographic data to estimate outdoor exposures by race-ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics (income, age, education), and by location (region, state, county, urban area) for the contiguous United States in 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: Estimated annual average NO2 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2010 for all of the race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status groups, including a decrease from 17.6\,ppb to 10.7\,ppb (-6.9\,ppb) in nonwhite [non-(white alone, non-Hispanic)] populations, and 12.6\,ppb to 7.8\,ppb (-4.7\,ppb) in white (white alone, non-Hispanic) populations. In 2000 and 2010, disparities in NO2 concentrations were larger by race-ethnicity than by income. Although the national nonwhite-white mean NO2 concentration disparity decreased from a difference of 5.0\,ppb in 2000 to 2.9\,ppb in 2010, estimated mean NO2 concentrations remained 37\% higher for nonwhites than whites in 2010 (40\% higher in 2000), and nonwhites were 2.5 times more likely than whites to live in a block group with an average NO2 concentration above the WHO annual guideline in 2010 (3.0 times more likely in 2000). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that absolute NO2 exposure disparities by race-ethnicity decreased from 2000 to 2010, but relative NO2 exposure disparities persisted, with higher NO2 concentrations for nonwhites than whites in 2010. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP959.},

We first document that early-life exposure to particulate matter is one of the top five predictors of upward mobility in the United States. Second, we exploit regulation-induced reductions in pollution exposure from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments to produce new age-specific estimates of pollution-earnings relationship. Combined with individual-level measures of pollution exposure during early childhood, we calculate that disparities in air pollution can account for 17-26 percent of the Black-White earnings gap, 5-27 percent of the Hispanic-White earnings gap, and 6-20 percent of the average neighborhood-earnings effect (Chetty and Hendren, 2018; Chetty, Hendren, and Katz, 2016). Collectively, our findings indicate that environmental inequality is an important contributor to observed patterns of racial economic disparities, income inequality and economic opportunity in the United States.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach to detect the frequency of interaction between any two genomic loci. Generation of a matrix of interaction frequencies between sites on the same or different chromosomes reveals their relative spatial disposition and provides information about the physical properties of the chromatin fiber. This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               , we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G               1               stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted ring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that long-term exposure to air pollution increases mortality. However, evidence is limited for air-pollution levels below the most recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Previous studies involved predominantly urban populations and did not have the statistical power to estimate the health effects in underrepresented groups. METHODS: We constructed an open cohort of all Medicare beneficiaries (60,925,443 persons) in the continental United States from the years 2000 through 2012, with 460,310,521 person-years of follow-up. Annual averages of fine particulate matter (particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 {$\mu$}m [PM2.5]) and ozone were estimated according to the ZIP Code of residence for each enrollee with the use of previously validated prediction models. We estimated the risk of death associated with exposure to increases of 10 {$\mu$}g per cubic meter for PM2.5 and 10 parts per billion (ppb) for ozone using a two-pollutant Cox proportional-hazards model that controlled for demographic characteristics, Medicaid eligibility, and area-level covariates. RESULTS: Increases of 10 {$\mu$}g per cubic meter in PM2.5 and of 10 ppb in ozone were associated with increases in all-cause mortality of 7.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.1 to 7.5) and 1.1\% (95\% CI, 1.0 to 1.2), respectively. When the analysis was restricted to person-years with exposure to PM2.5 of less than 12 {$\mu$}g per cubic meter and ozone of less than 50 ppb, the same increases in PM2.5 and ozone were associated with increases in the risk of death of 13.6\% (95\% CI, 13.1 to 14.1) and 1.0\% (95\% CI, 0.9 to 1.1), respectively. For PM2.5, the risk of death among men, blacks, and people with Medicaid eligibility was higher than that in the rest of the population. CONCLUSIONS: In the entire Medicare population, there was significant evidence of adverse effects related to exposure to PM2.5 and ozone at concentrations below current national standards. This effect was most pronounced among self-identified racial minorities and people with low income. (Supported by the Health Effects Institute and others.).},

Up to 80\% of variants seem to have tissue-specific functions when compared in fibroblasts, as well as B cells and T cells. This variation among regulatory variants correlated with transcript complexity, which suggests that some of the observed regulatory variation is due to genotype-specific use of transcripts and transcription start sites.                        ,              Genetic variation in regulatory elements among humans affects gene expression in a tissue-specific manner.           ,              Studies correlating genetic variation to gene expression facilitate the interpretation of common human phenotypes and disease. As functional variants may be operating in a tissue-dependent manner, we performed gene expression profiling and association with genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on three cell types of 75 individuals. We detected cell type\textendash specific genetic effects, with 69 to 80\% of regulatory variants operating in a cell type\textendash specific manner, and identified multiple expressive quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) per gene, unique or shared among cell types and positively correlated with the number of transcripts per gene. Cell type\textendash specific eQTLs were found at larger distances from genes and at lower effect size, similar to known enhancers. These data suggest that the complete regulatory variant repertoire can only be uncovered in the context of cell-type specificity.},

  abstract = {Several classical methods exist for controlling the false discovery exceedance (FDX) for large-scale multiple testing problems, among them the Lehmann-Romano procedure (Lehmann and Romano 2005) ([LR] below) and the Guo-Romano procedure (Guo and Romano 2007) ([GR] below). While these two procedures are the most prominent, they were originally designed for homogeneous test statistics, that is, when the null distribution functions of the p-values Fi, 1 {$\leq$} i {$\leq$} m, are all equal. In many applications, however, the data are heterogeneous which leads to heterogeneous null distribution functions. Ignoring this heterogeneity induces a lack of power. In this paper, we develop three new procedures that incorporate the Fi's, while maintaining rigorous FDX control. The heterogeneous version of [LR], denoted [HLR], is based on the arithmetic average of the Fi's, while the heterogeneous version of [GR], denoted [HGR], is based on the geometric average of the Fi's. We also introduce a procedure [PB], that is based on the Poisson-binomial distribution and that uniformly improves [HLR] and [HGR], at the price of a higher computational complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that, contrary to the known theory of false discovery rate (FDR) control under heterogeneity, the way to incorporate the Fi's can be particularly simple in the case of FDX control, and does not require any further correction term. The performances of the new proposed procedures are illustrated by real and simulated data in two important heterogeneous settings: first, when the test statistics are continuous but the p-values are weighted by some known independent weight vector, e.g., coming from co-data sets; second, when the test statistics are discretely distributed, as is the case for data representing frequencies or counts. Our new procedures are implemented in the R package FDX, see Junge and D\textasciidieresis ohler (2020).},

However, how to achieve this task in an optimal way is rarely considered in the literature. This paper contributes to fill the gap in the case of group-structured null hypotheses, by introducing a new class of procedures named ADDOW (for Adaptive Data Driven Optimal Weighting) that adapts both to the alternative distribution and to the proportion of true null hypotheses. We prove the asymptotical FDR control and power optimality among all weighted procedures of ADDOW, which shows that it dominates all existing procedures in that framework. Some numerical experiments show that the proposed method preserves its optimal properties in the finite sample setting when the number of tests is moderately large.},

  abstract = {Regression discontinuity designs are used to estimate causal effects in settings where treatment is determined by whether an observed running variable crosses a pre-specified threshold. While the resulting sampling design is sometimes described as akin to a locally randomized experiment in a neighborhood of the threshold, standard formal analyses do not make reference to probabilistic treatment assignment and instead identify treatment effects via continuity arguments. Here we propose a new approach to identification, estimation, and inference in regression discontinuity designs that exploits measurement error, or other noise, in the running variable. Under an assumption that the measurement error is exogenous, we show how to estimate causal effects using a class of linear estimators that weight treated and control units so as to balance a latent variable of which the running variable is a noisy measure. We find this approach to facilitate inference for familiar estimands from the literature, as well as policy-relevant estimands that correspond to the effects of realistic changes to the existing treatment assignment rule. We demonstrate the method with a study of retention of HIV patients, and evaluate its performance using both simulated data and a regression discontinuity design artificially constructed from test scores in early childhood.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short-term increases in particulate air pollution are linked with increased daily mortality and morbidity. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a determinant of overall health. We investigated whether social class is an effect modifier of the PM(10) (particulate matter with diameter {$<$}10 micron)-daily mortality association, and possible mechanisms for this effect modification. METHODS: Area-based traffic emissions, income, and SES were available for each resident in Rome. All natural deaths (83,253 subjects) occurring in Rome among city residents (aged 35+ years) during the period 1998-2001 were identified. For each deceased individual, all the previous hospitalizations within 2 years before death were available via a record linkage procedure. PM(10) daily data were available from two urban monitoring sites. A case-crossover analysis was utilized in which control days were selected according to the time stratified approach (same day of the week during the same month). Conditional logistic regression was used. RESULTS: Due to the social class distribution in the city, exposure to traffic emissions was higher among those with higher area-based income and SES. Meanwhile, people of lower social class had suffered to a larger extent from chronic diseases before death than more affluent residents, especially diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Overall, PM(10) (lag 0-1) was strongly associated with mortality (1.1\% increase, 95\%CI = 0.7-1.6\%, per 10 microg/m(3)). The effect was more pronounced among persons with lower income and SES (1.9\% and 1.4\% per 10 microg/m(3), respectively) compared to those in the upper income and SES levels (0.0\% and 0.1\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm previous suggestions of a stronger effect of particulate air pollution among people in low social class. Given the uneven geographical distributions of social deprivation and traffic emissions in Rome, the most likely explanation is a differential burden of chronic health conditions conferring a greater susceptibility to less advantaged people.},

  abstract = {Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained momentum in the context of machine learning due to their high capacity and tree-likeliness properties. However, the representational power of hyperbolic geometry is not yet on par with Euclidean geometry, mostly because of the absence of corresponding hyperbolic neural network layers. This makes it hard to use hyperbolic embeddings in downstream tasks. Here, we bridge this gap in a principled manner by combining the formalism of M\textbackslash "obius gyrovector spaces with the Riemannian geometry of the Poincar\textbackslash 'e model of hyperbolic spaces. As a result, we derive hyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as gated recurrent units. This allows to embed sequential data and perform classification in the hyperbolic space. Empirically, we show that, even if hyperbolic optimization tools are limited, hyperbolic sentence embeddings either outperform or are on par with their Euclidean variants on textual entailment and noisy-prefix recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Given the serious adverse health effects associated with many pollutants, and the inequitable distribution of these effects between socioeconomic groups, air pollution is often a focus of environmental justice (EJ) research. However, EJ analyses that aim to illuminate whether and how air pollution hazards are inequitably distributed may present a unique set of requirements for estimating pollutant concentrations compared to other air quality applications. Here, we perform a scoping review of the range of data analytic and modeling methods applied in past studies of air pollution and environmental injustice and develop a guidance framework for selecting between them given the purpose of analysis, users, and resources available. We include proxy, monitor-based, statistical, and process-based methods. Upon critically synthesizing the literature, we identify four main dimensions to inform method selection: accuracy, interpretability, spatiotemporal features of the method, and usability of the method. We illustrate the guidance framework with case studies from the literature. Future research in this area includes an exploration of increasing data availability, advanced statistical methods, and the importance of science-based policy.},

However, obtaining valid pvalues relies on either reasonable assumptions of data distribution or large numbers of replicates under both conditions.

We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution has been recognized as a major source of mortality in the United States for at least 25 years, yet much remains unknown about which sources are the most harmful, let alone how best to target policies to mitigate them. Such efforts can be improved by employing high-resolution geographically explicit methods for quantifying human health impacts of emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors. Here, we provide a detailed examination of the health and economic impacts of PM2.5 pollution in the United States by linking emission sources with resulting pollution concentrations. We estimate that anthropogenic PM2.5 was responsible for 107,000 premature deaths in 2011, at a cost to society of \$886 billion. Of these deaths, 57\% were associated with pollution caused by energy consumption [e.g., transportation (28\%) and electricity generation (14\%)]; another 15\% with pollution caused by agricultural activities. A small fraction of emissions, concentrated in or near densely populated areas, plays an outsized role in damaging human health with the most damaging 10\% of total emissions accounting for 40\% of total damages. We find that 33\% of damages occur within 8 km of emission sources, but 25\% occur more than 256 km away, emphasizing the importance of tracking both local and long-range impacts. Our paper highlights the importance of a fine-scale approach as marginal damages can vary by over an order of magnitude within a single county. Information presented here can assist mitigation efforts by identifying those sources with the greatest health effects.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the impact of genetic variants on gene regulation is fundamental to understanding human disease. Although gene regulation often involves long-range interactions, it is unknown to what extent non-coding genetic variants influence distal molecular phenotypes. Here, we integrate chromatin profiling for three histone marks in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 75 sequenced individuals with LCL-specific Hi-C and ChIA-PET-based chromatin contact maps to uncover one of the largest collections of local and distal histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). Distal QTLs are enriched within topologically associated domains and exhibit largely concordant variation of chromatin state coordinated by proximal and distal non-coding genetic variants. Histone QTLs are enriched for common variants associated with autoimmune diseases and enable identification of putative target genes of disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studies. These analyses provide insights into how genetic variation can affect human disease phenotypes by coordinated changes in chromatin at interacting regulatory elements.},

Specifically, in epidemiological cohort studies and clinical registries we are facing the question of what can be learned from the data in an early phase of the study, when only a baseline characterization and one follow-up measurement are available. Inspired by recent advances that allow to combine deep learning with dynamic modeling, we investigate whether such approaches can be useful for uncovering complex structure, in particular for an extreme small data setting with only two observations time points for each individual. Irregular spacing in time could then be used to gain more information on individual dynamics by leveraging similarity of individuals. We provide a brief overview of how variational autoencoders (VAEs), as a deep learning approach, can be linked to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for dynamic modeling, and then specifically investigate the feasibility of such an approach that infers individual-specific latent trajectories by including regularity assumptions and individuals' similarity. We also provide a description of this deep learning approach as a filtering task to give a statistical perspective. Using simulated data, we show to what extent the approach can recover individual trajectories from ODE systems with two and four unknown parameters and infer groups of individuals with similar trajectories, and where it breaks down. The results show that such dynamic deep learning approaches can be useful even in extreme small data settings, but need to be carefully adapted.},

  abstract = {Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of high-dimensional molecular variables, are increasingly often generated for the investigation of various diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness of multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time. It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction models. We aim to give some answers to these questions through a large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets (35 to 1000 observations, up to 100 000 variables) from the database `The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA). The considered outcome was the (censored) survival time. Eleven methods based on boosting, penalized regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The Kaplan\textendash Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier score served as performance metrics. The results indicate that methods taking into account the multi-omics structure have a slightly better prediction performance. Taking this structure into account can protect the predictive information in low-dimensional groups\textemdash especially clinical variables\textemdash from not being exploited during prediction. Moreover, only the block forest method outperformed the Cox model on average, and only slightly. This indicates, as a by-product of our study, that in the considered TCGA studies the utility of multi-omics data for prediction purposes was limited.},

This suggests that qualitative and quantitative examination of the loss landscape geometry could yield insights about neural network generalization performance during training. To this end, researchers have proposed visualizing the loss landscape through the use of simple dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such visualization methods have been limited by their linear nature and only capture features in one or two dimensions, thus restricting sampling of the loss landscape to lines or planes. Here, we expand and improve upon these in three ways. First, we present a novel ``jump and retrain'' procedure for sampling relevant portions of the loss landscape. We show that the resulting sampled data holds more meaningful information about the network's ability to generalize. Next, we show that non-linear dimensionality reduction of the jump and retrain trajectories via PHATE, a trajectory and manifold-preserving method, allows us to visualize differences between networks that are generalizing well vs poorly. Finally, we combine PHATE trajectories with a computational homology characterization to quantify trajectory differences.},

  abstract = {Road pricing is increasingly considered as an option to support transportation infrastructure costs, manage demand, and reduce emissions. However, the extent to which implementation of such approaches may impact transportation and health equity is unclear. In this scoping review, we examine the differential transportation and health effects of road pricing policies across population groups and geographic region. We conducted a systematic database search of Transport Research International Documentation, GEOBASE, Scopus, and Ovid Medline, supplemented by bibliographic review and internet searches. Fifteen studies were included in the review. The studies evaluated area and cordon road pricing systems in Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan, and Gothenburg, and had a median follow-up period of 12 months. Outcomes evaluated include car commuting, mode shift to public transit, accessibility to destinations, affordability, welfare, social interactions, air pollution, traffic injuries and deaths, acute asthma attacks, and life expectancy. While more studies across diverse urban contexts and policy settings will be needed to strengthen the evidence base, the existing evidence suggests road pricing has mostly net positive effects related to a reduction in car trips, air pollution, asthma attacks, and road traffic collisions, and increases in life expectancy. Frequency and ease of social interactions were found to be negatively impacted, with fewer visits to family and friends. The population groups that generally fared better across transportation and health outcomes were those with higher incomes, men, and people between the ages of 35\textendash 55. Across space, there are benefits for both the areas inside and outside the cordon boundary, but to a greater degree for the area inside. Overall, the evidence base is limited by a narrow set of health-related outcomes and a lack of longer-term studies. We did not come across any studies assessing distributional effects of noise pollution, mode shifts to walking or cycling, or other morbidities in the general population that are not listed above. In addition, there are few evaluations that include non-work trips, therefore potentially missing effects for unemployed populations or women who are more likely to make non-work trips. We find that the limited body of evidence on area and cordon pricing policies suggests these policies are beneficial for a number of transportation and health outcomes, particularly for populations inside the cordon area, but that there may be some degree of inequities in the distribution of the benefits and burdens.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid {$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) and intraneuronal tau protein aggregations. One risk factor for developing AD is the APOE gene coding for the apolipoprotein E protein (apoE). Humans have three versions of APOE gene: {$\epsilon$}2, {$\epsilon$}3, and {$\epsilon$}4 allele. Carrying the {$\epsilon$}4 allele is an AD risk factor while carrying the {$\epsilon$}2 allele is protective. ApoE is a component of lipoprotein particles in the plasma at the periphery, as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain parenchyma in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is a major lipid transporter that plays a pivotal role in the development, maintenance, and repair of the CNS, and that regulates multiple important signaling pathways. This review will focus on the critical role of apoE in AD pathogenesis and some of the currently apoE-based therapeutics developed in the treatment of AD.},

The situation is asymmetric in that a prior is posited for the nuisance parameters (variances) but not the primary parameters (means). If the prior were known, one could proceed by computing pvalues conditional on sample variances; a strategy called partially Bayes inference by Sir David Cox. These conditional p-values satisfy a Tweedie-type formula and are approximated at nearly-parametric rates when the prior is estimated by nonparametric maximum likelihood. If the variances are in fact fixed, the approach retains type-I error guarantees.},

  abstract = {1 Setting ((P i , X i)) i{$\in$}[m] , where now X i {$\in$} X can be an arbitrary feature, for example X = R p , or anything that regression trees can deal with. The basic idea is the following: we know how to handle categorical covariates (now with less restrictions on how many categories there are). So we may seek to aggressively discretize D : X \textrightarrow{} [G], e.g., through a binary tree. As long as discretization is embedded within the cross-fold procedure, the procedure will control FDR. If the tree structures are themselves random (induced, say by within-fold bootstrapping or random feature subsampling; or even the cross-fold assignment in the case of full independence), then we will have a (cross-fold) weight W it per tree t and per test i. Then we could let W i = W i{$\cdot$} be the random forest IHW weight for test i. To implement this approach, however, we need a fast way of constructing powerful tree structures. 2 Constructing IHW trees Finding optimal tree structures is combinatorially infeasible even for simpler tasks; say regression. Thus we will focus our attention on CART-like trees [Breiman et al., 1984] that greedily seek to find the best split in each iteration. To find an optimal split, in turn, we need an objective function by which to evaluate splits. At the end of the day, we care about the total number of discoveries we will make. However, this also seems intractable: we would need to apply the Grenander-optimization in each step of tree-building and for each feature and each possible split-point. Instead we seek for a proxy "objective" that can be evaluated rapidly; the hope is that the exact tree structure is not too important (e.g., already very coarse quantile slicing has served us well). However, we do want to pick up on heterogeneity in the two-groups model. 2.1 Boca-Leek trees We build the tree so it can capture heterogeneity in {$\pi$} 0 (x) = P [H i = 0 | X i = x], i.e., we define our objective as L({$\pi$} 0 , {$\pi$} 0) = X ({$\pi$} 0 (x) - {$\pi$} 0 (x)) 2 dP X (x) Here {$\pi$} 0 (x) is just Storey's {$\pi$} 0 estimator applied to all tests that land in the same leaf as x.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable interest in using decomposition methods in epidemiology (mediation analysis) and economics (Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition) to understand how health disparities arise and how they might change upon intervention. It has not been clear when estimates from the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition can be interpreted causally because its implementation does not explicitly address potential confounding of target variables. While mediation analysis does explicitly adjust for confounders of target variables, it typically does so in a way that effectively entails equalizing confounders across racial groups, which may not reflect the intended intervention. Revisiting prior analyses in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on disparities in wages, unemployment, incarceration, and overall health with test scores, taken as a proxy for educational attainment, as a target intervention, we propose and demonstrate a novel decomposition that controls for confounders of test scores (e.g. measures of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]) while leaving their association with race intact. We compare this decomposition with others that use standardization (to equalize childhood SES [the confounders] alone), mediation analysis (to equalize test scores within levels of childhood SES), and one that equalizes both childhood SES and test scores. We also show how these decompositions, including our novel proposals, are equivalent to implementations of the Oaxaca\textendash Blinder decomposition, but provide a more formal causal interpretation for these decompositions.},

We present the first large scale study of generalization in deep networks. We investigate more then 40 complexity measures taken from both theoretical bounds and empirical studies. We train over 10,000 convolutional networks by systematically varying commonly used hyperparameters. Hoping to uncover potentially causal relationships between each measure and generalization, we analyze carefully controlled experiments and show surprising failures of some measures as well as promising measures for further research.},

However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (               https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl               ), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.},

These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say 32\textendash 512 data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions\textemdash and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

  abstract = {Cell type composition, estimated from bulk tissue, maps the cellular specificity of genetic variants.           ,              Cell type\textendash specific quantitative trait loci                            Understanding how human genetic variation affects phenotype requires tissue- or even cell type\textendash specific measurements. Kim-Hellmuth               et al.               used computational methods to identify cell-type proportions within bulk tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project dataset to identify cell-type interaction quantitative trait loci and map these to genetic variants correlated with expression or splicing differences between individuals. By characterizing the cellular context, this study illustrates how genetic variants that operate in a cell type\textendash specific manner affect gene regulation and can be linked to complex traits. This deconvolution and analysis of cell types from bulk tissues allows greater precision in understanding how phenotypes are linked to genetic variation.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaaz8528                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               Efforts to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across human tissues by the GTEx Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing QTLs (eQTLs and sQTLs, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a QTL is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type\textendash specific QTLs from bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to GTEx tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits.                                         RATIONALE               A growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type\textendash specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the GTEx project to map QTLs that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for expression and splicing (ieQTLs and isQTLs, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment.                                         RESULTS               Using 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes with an ieQTL and 987 genes with an isQTL (at 5\% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the QTLs for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from eQTL heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for patterns of tissue sharing and found that ieQTLs are enriched for genes with tissue-specific eQTLs and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific eQTLs originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the ieQTLs and isQTLs for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type\textendash interaction QTLs are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of {$>$}50\% over colocalizations with standard QTLs. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard QTLs.                                         CONCLUSION               The ieQTLs and isQTLs identified for seven cell types across GTEx tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type\textendash specific QTLs remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type\textendash specific QTLs will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping QTLs in single cells.                                                   Detection of cell type\textendash specific effects on gene expression.                   The enrichment of seven cell types is calculated across GTEx tissues, enabling mapping of cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for expression and splicing by testing for significant interactions between genotypes and cell type enrichments. Linking these QTLs to complex trait associations enables discovery of {$>$}50\% more colocalizations compared with standard QTLs and reveals the cellular specificity of traits.                                                                         ,              The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has identified expression and splicing quantitative trait loci in cis (QTLs) for the majority of genes across a wide range of human tissues. However, the functional characterization of these QTLs has been limited by the heterogeneous cellular composition of GTEx tissue samples. We mapped interactions between computational estimates of cell type abundance and genotype to identify cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for seven cell types and show that cell type\textendash interaction expression QTLs (eQTLs) provide finer resolution to tissue specificity than bulk tissue cis-eQTLs. Analyses of genetic associations with 87 complex traits show a contribution from cell type\textendash interaction QTLs and enables the discovery of hundreds of previously unidentified colocalized loci that are masked in bulk tissue.},

Results\textemdash We found an association between long-term PM2.5 and survival (HR = 1.2; 95\%CI: 1.1\textendash 1.3 per 10 \textmu g/m3 increase in the annual PM2.5 average concentrations). We observed elevated estimates in the Southeastern, South and Northwestern U.S. (HR = 1.9; 95\%CI: 1.7\textendash 2.2, 1.4; 95\%CI: 1.2\textendash 1.7 and 1.4; 95\%CI: 1.1\textendash 1.9 respectively).

Furthermore, we observed increasing estimates with increasing obesity rates, \%residents and families in poverty, \%black residents and \%population without a high school degree, and lower effects with increasing median household income and \%white residents. Conclusions\textemdash To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess modification by temperature and community-level characteristics on the long-term PM2.5\textendash survival association.

  abstract = {Background: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Results: Methods that incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative. The majority of methods are successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increases with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Conclusions: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

  abstract = {Background The influence of the sociodemographic context of one's environment on cognitive ageing is not well understood. Methods We examined differences in cognitive trajectories according to the racial/ethnic characteristics of the residential environment. On the basis of 63 996 person-years of data from a nationally representative cohort of 6150 adults over the age of 50 years from the Health and Retirement Study, we used multivariate linear mixed models to determine the effect of neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition and county-level segregation on cognitive function and cognitive decline over a 10-year period. Results In models adjusting for individual demographic and health characteristics, Hispanic composition had a significant positive association with cognitive function (standardised {$\beta$}=0.136, p{$<$}0.05) and moderate evidence of an association with greater cognitive decline (standardised {$\beta$}=-0.014, p=0.09). Greater Hispanicwhite segregation was associated with statistically significant higher cognitive function at baseline (standardised {$\beta$}=0.099, p{$<$}0.001) and greater cognitive decline (standardised {$\beta$}=-0.011, p{$<$}0.01). For a 20 percentage-point increase in Hispanic composition and segregation, the observed associations implied 1 and 1.25 additional years of cognitive ageing over 10 years, respectively. These effects did not differ by individual race/ethnicity and were not explained by neighbourhood socioeconomic status or neighbourhood selection. Black composition and black-white segregation did not have a significant influence on cognitive ageing. Discussion This study demonstrates disparities in the progression of cognitive ageing according to racial/ethnic characteristics of the neighbourhood environment.},

The project, which generated .70 billion genotypes, represents the first large-scale use of the Affymetrix Axiom Genotyping Solution. Because genotyping took place over a short 14-month period, creating a near-real-time analysis pipeline for experimental assay quality control and final optimized analyses was critical. Because of the multi-ethnic nature of the cohort, four different ethnic-specific arrays were employed to enhance genome-wide coverage. All assays were performed on DNA extracted from saliva samples. To improve sample call rates and significantly increase genotype concordance, we partitioned the cohort into disjoint packages of plates with similar assay contexts. Using strict QC criteria, the overall genotyping success rate was 103,067 of 109,837 samples assayed (93.8\%), with a range of 92.1\textendash 95.4\% for the four different arrays. Similarly, the SNP genotyping success rate ranged from 98.1 to 99.4\% across the four arrays, the variation depending mostly on how many SNPs were included as single copy vs. double copy on a particular array. The high quality and large scale of genotype data created on this cohort, in conjunction with comprehensive longitudinal data from the KP electronic health records of participants, will enable a broad range of highly powered genome-wide association studies on a diversity of traits and conditions.},

The Babylonians and ancient Egyptians utilized cross pollination of crops and selection of domesticated animals for breeding, but did not develop a formal theory for the principles underlying the inheritance of traits. Later, ancient Greek philosophers developed elementary theories to explain how inheritance worked in humans, grappling unsuccessfully with the apparent paradox that inherited characteristics can sometimes differ between offspring and parents. Some diseases in humans, such as sickle cell anemia and hemophilia, have been recognized as inherited disorders for centuries and, as the science of medicine developed, so too did the recognition that many diseases are heritable.},

  abstract = {Rejecting the null hypothesis in two-sample testing is a fundamental tool for scientific discovery. Yet, aside from concluding that two samples do not come from the same probability distribution, it is often of interest to characterize how the two distributions differ. Given samples from two densities f1 and f0, we consider the task of localizing occurrences of the inequality f1 {$>$} f0. To avoid the challenges associated with high-dimensional space, we propose a general hypothesis testing framework where hypotheses are formulated adaptively to the data by conditioning on the combined sample from the two densities. We then investigate a special case of this framework where the notion of locality is captured by a random walk on a weighted graph constructed over this combined sample. We derive a tractable testing procedure for this case employing a type of scan statistic, and provide non-asymptotic lower bounds on the power and accuracy of our test to detect whether f1 {$>$} f0 in a local sense. Furthermore, we characterize the test's consistency according to a certain problem-hardness parameter, and show that our test achieves the minimax detection rate for this parameter. We conduct numerical experiments to validate our method, and demonstrate our approach on two real-world applications: detecting and localizing arsenic well contamination across the United States, and analyzing two-sample single-cell RNA sequencing data from melanoma patients.},

We explore here how redlining, a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice from the 1930s by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), relates to present-day intraurban air pollution disparities in 202 U.S. cities. In each city, we integrated three sources of data: (1) detailed HOLC security maps of investment risk grades [A (``best''), B, C, and D (``hazardous'', i.e., redlined)], (2) year-2010 estimates of NO2 and PM2.5 air pollution levels, and (3) demographic information from the 2010 U.S. census. We find that pollution levels have a consistent and nearly monotonic association with HOLC grade, with especially pronounced ({$>$}50\%) increments in NO2 levels between the most (grade A) and least (grade D) preferentially graded neighborhoods. On a national basis, intraurban disparities for NO2 and PM2.5 are substantially larger by historical HOLC grade than they are by race and ethnicity. However, within each HOLC grade, racial and ethnic air pollution exposure disparities persist, indicating that redlining was only one of the many racially discriminatory policies that impacted communities. Our findings illustrate how redlining, a nearly 80-year-old racially discriminatory policy, continues to shape systemic environmental exposure disparities in the United States.},

Recently, we developed a method for quantitative traits that estimates the variation accounted for when fitting all SNPs simultaneously. Here we develop this method further for case-control studies. We use a linear mixed model for analysis of binary traits and transform the estimates to a liability scale by adjusting both for scale and for ascertainment of the case samples. We show by theory and simulation that the method is unbiased. We apply the method to data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and show that a substantial proportion of variation in liability for Crohn disease, bipolar disorder, and type I diabetes is tagged by common SNPs.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of multiple-hypothesis testing with generic side information: for each hypothesis H i we observe both a p-value p i and some predictor x i encoding con-textual information about the hypothesis. For large-scale problems, adaptively focusing power on the more promising hypotheses (those more likely to yield discoveries) can lead to much more powerful multiple-testing procedures. We propose a general iterative framework for this problem, the adaptive p-value thresholding procedure which we call AdaPT, which adaptively estimates a Bayes optimal p-value rejection threshold and controls the false discovery rate in finite samples. At each iteration of the procedure, the analyst proposes a rejection threshold and observes partially censored p-values, estimates the false discovery proportion below the threshold and proposes another threshold, until the estimated false discovery proportion is below {$\alpha$}. Our procedure is adaptive in an unusually strong sense, permitting the analyst to use any statistical or machine learning method she chooses to estimate the optimal threshold, and to switch between different models at each iteration as information accrues. We demonstrate the favourable performance of AdaPT by comparing it with state of the art methods in five real applications and two simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Multiple testing problems arising in modern scientific applications can involve simultaneously testing thousands or even millions of hypotheses, with relatively few true signals. In this article, we consider the multiple testing problem where prior information is available (for instance, from an earlier study under different experimental conditions), that can allow us to test the hypotheses as a ranked list to increase the number of discoveries. Given an ordered list of n hypotheses, the aim is to select a data-dependent cutoff k and declare the first k hypotheses to be statistically significant while bounding the false discovery rate (FDR). Generalizing several existing methods, we develop a family of ``accumulation tests'' to choose a cutoff k that adapts to the amount of signal at the top of the ranked list. We introduce a new method in this family, the HingeExp method, which offers higher power to detect true signals compared to existing techniques. Our theoretical results prove that these methods control a modified FDR on finite samples, and characterize the power of the methods in the family. We apply the tests to simulated data, including a high-dimensional model selection problem for linear regression. We also compare accumulation tests to existing methods for multiple testing on a real data problem of identifying differential gene expression over a dosage gradient.

Many modifications of this procedure have been proposed to improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce the `structure-adaptive Benjamini\textendash Hochberg algorithm' (SABHA) as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. The SABHA method incorporates prior information about any predetermined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that the SABHA method controls the FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the data\textemdash interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights. We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including ordered, grouped and low total variation structures, and obtain the bounds on the FDR for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of the SABHA method on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity data and on gene\textendash drug response data, as well as on simulated data.},

However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple ``filter normalization'' method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.},

  abstract = {In physics, it is sometimes desirable to compute the so-called density of states (DOS), also known as the spectral density, of a real symmetric matrix  {$\mathsl{A}$} A . The spectral density can be viewed as a probability density distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near some point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this density is to compute all eigenvalues of  {$\mathsl{A}$} A , but this approach is generally costly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large dimension. There exist alternative methods that allow us to estimate the spectral density function at much lower cost. The major computational cost of these methods is in multiplying  {$\mathsl{A}$} A  with a number of vectors, which makes them appealing for large-scale problems where products of the matrix  {$\mathsl{A}$} A  with arbitrary vectors are relatively inexpensive. This article defines the problem of estimating the spectral density carefully and discusses how to measure the accuracy of an approximate spectral density. It then surveys a few known methods for estimating the spectral density and considers variations of existing methods. All methods are discussed from a numerical linear algebra point of view.},

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples\textemdash which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers.},

In modern large-scale data analysis, correlation and sparsity are common features and efficient computation is a necessary requirement for dealing with massive data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new test that takes advantage of the Cauchy distribution. Our test statistic has a simple form and is defined as a weighted sum of Cauchy transformation of individual p-values. We prove a nonasymptotic result that the tail of the null distribution of our proposed test statistic can be well approximated by a Cauchy distribution under arbitrary dependency structures. Based on this theoretical result, the p-value calculation of our proposed test is not only accurate, but also as simple as the classic z-test or t-test, making our test well suited for analyzing massive data. We further show that the power of the proposed test is asymptotically optimal in a strong sparsity setting. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed test has both strong power against sparse alternatives and a good accuracy with respect to p-value calculations, especially for very small p-values. The proposed test has also been applied to a genome-wide association study of Crohn's disease and compared with several existing tests.

Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify exposure disparities by race/ethnicity and income throughout the contiguous United States for six criteria air pollutants, during the period 1990 to 2010. Methods: We quantified exposure disparities among racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic (any race), non-Hispanic Asian) and by income for multiple spatial units (contiguous United States, states, urban vs. rural areas) and years (1990, 2000, 2010) for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 NO2 ), ozone ( O 3 O3 ), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}2.5{$\mu$}m {$\leq$}2.5{$\mu$}m ( PM 2.5 PM2.5 ; excluding year-1990), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}10{$\mu$}m {$\leq$}10{$\mu$}m ( PM 10 PM10 ), and sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 SO2 ). We used census data for demographic information and a national empirical model for ambient air pollution levels. Results: For all years and pollutants, the racial/ethnic group with the highest national average exposure was a racial/ethnic minority group. In 2010, the disparity between the racial/ethnic group with the highest vs. lowest national-average exposure was largest for NO 2 NO2 [54\% ( 4.6\,ppb 4.6\,ppb )], smallest for O 3 O3 [3.6\% ( 1.6\,ppb 1.6\,ppb )], and intermediate for the remaining pollutants (13\%\textendash 19\%). The disparities varied by U.S. state; for example, for PM 2.5 PM2.5 in 2010, exposures were at least 5\% higher than average in 63\% of states for non-Hispanic Black populations; in 33\% and 26\% of states for Hispanic and for non-Hispanic Asian populations, respectively; and in no states for non-Hispanic White populations. Absolute exposure disparities were larger among racial/ethnic groups than among income categories (range among pollutants: between 1.1 and 21 times larger). Over the period studied, national absolute racial/ethnic exposure disparities declined by between 35\% ( 0.6 6{$\mu$}g/m 3 0.66{$\mu$}g/m3 ; PM 2.5 PM2.5 ) and 88\% ( 0.35\,ppm 0.35\,ppm ; CO); relative disparities declined to between 0.99\texttimes{} 0.99\texttimes{} ( PM 2.5 PM2.5 ; i.e., nearly zero change) and 0.71\texttimes{} 0.71\texttimes{} (CO; i.e., a {$\sim$}29\% {$\sim$}29\% reduction). Discussion: As air pollution concentrations declined during the period 1990 to 2010, absolute (and to a lesser extent, relative) racial/ethnic exposure disparities also declined. However, in 2010, racial/ethnic exposure disparities remained across income levels, in urban and rural areas, and in all states, for multiple pollutants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8584},

  abstract = {SUMMARY. We consider a semiparametric regression model that relates a normal outcome to covariates and a genetic pathway, where the covariate effects are modeled parametrically and the pathway effect of multiple gene expressions is modeled parametrically or nonparametrically using least squares kernel machines (LSKMs). This unified framework allows a flexible function for the joint effect of multiple genes within a pathway by specifying a kernel function and allows for the possibility that each gene expression effect might be nonlinear and the genes within the same pathway are likely to interact with each other in a complicated way. This semiparametric model also makes it possible to test for the overall genetic pathway effect. We show that the LSKM semiparametric regression can be formulated using a linear mixed model. Estimation and inference hence can proceed within the linear mixed model framework using standard mixed model software. Both the regression coefficients of the covariate effects and the LSKM estimator of the genetic pathway effect can be obtained using the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor(BLUP)in the corresponding linear mixed model formulation. The smoothing parameter and the kernel parameter can be estimated as variance components using Restricted Maximum Likelihood(REML). A score test is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect. Model/variable selection within the LSKM framework is discussed. The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations.},

  abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P~{$<~$}5~\texttimes ~10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for {$\sim$}2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {$>$}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

  abstract = {Social scientists regularly rely on population estimates when studying change in small areas over time. Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, since there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own re-tabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base or NCDB), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by NHGIS uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations, but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources.},

For certain disorders such as muscular dystrophy, it may be possible to achieve therapeutic benefit by editing the faulty gene in somatic cells. In proof-of-concept studies, Long               et al.               , Nelson               et al.               , and Tabebordbar               et al.               used adeno-associated virus-9 to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to young mice with a mutation in the gene coding for dystrophin, a muscle protein deficient in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gene editing partially restored dystrophin protein expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle and improved skeletal muscle function.

To correct DMD by skipping mutant dystrophin exons in postnatal muscle tissue in vivo, we used adeno-associated virus\textendash 9 (AAV9) to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal               mdx               mice, a model of DMD. Different modes of AAV9 delivery were systematically tested, including intraperitoneal at postnatal day 1 (P1), intramuscular at P12, and retro-orbital at P18. Each of these methods restored dystrophin protein expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle to varying degrees, and expression increased from 3 to 12 weeks after injection. Postnatal gene editing also enhanced skeletal muscle function, as measured by grip strength tests 4 weeks after injection. This method provides a potential means of correcting mutations responsible for DMD and other monogenic disorders after birth.},

The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-todate workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial. This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Communities of color in the United States (U.S.) are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards. However, few studies have examined the relationship between historical discriminatory practices and current environmental hazard exposure, across a range of locations and hazards. In the 1930s, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) created community maps to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments, using grades A (good) to D (poor), a practice known as redlining. We conducted an ecological study to assess the association between historical redlining and present-day environmental hazards in 196 U.S. communities. METHODS: HOLC security maps were obtained from the University of Richmond's Mapping Inequality Project. We used a spatial weighting method to assign a redlining score to each census tract, where at least 20\% of its area was previously graded, so that higher scores represented tracts with more ``D'' rated neighborhoods. Data on air quality and proximity to hazardous waste and Superfund sites were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EJSCREEN. We used linear mixed effects regression models, with a random intercept for community, to assess the relationship between redlining score and current environmental hazards. Models were adjusted for percent minority population and poverty. RESULTS:Census tracts in the fourth quartile of redlining score had higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM{$_2$}.{$_5$}) [beta=0.05, 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.06] and diesel particulate matter [beta=0.12, 95\% CI: 0.10, 0.14] than census tracts in the first quartile. Census tracts in the fourth quartile were also significantly closer to hazardous waste and Superfund sites than census tracts in the first quartile. We also demonstrate a publicly-available tool to visualize this data. CONCLUSIONS:We found evidence for an association between historical government-sponsored discriminatory practices and disproportionate environmental burden in communities today. These results add to the growing literature pointing to the role of systemic racism in environmental injustice.

  abstract = {Resequencing is an emerging tool for identification of rare disease-associated mutations. Rare mutations are difficult to tag with SNP genotyping, as genotyping studies are designed to detect common variants. However, studies have shown that genetic heterogeneity is a probable scenario for common diseases, in which multiple rare mutations together explain a large proportion of the genetic basis for the disease. Thus, we propose a weighted-sum method to jointly analyse a group of mutations in order to test for groupwise association with disease status. For example, such a group of mutations may result from resequencing a gene. We compare the proposed weighted-sum method to alternative methods and show that it is powerful for identifying disease-associated genes, both on simulated and Encode data. Using the weighted-sum method, a resequencing study can identify a disease-associated gene with an overall population attributable risk (PAR) of 2\%, even when each individual mutation has much lower PAR, using 1,000 to 7,000 affected and unaffected individuals, depending on the underlying genetic model. This study thus demonstrates that resequencing studies can identify important genetic associations, provided that specialised analysis methods, such as the weighted-sum method, are used.},

  abstract = {Challenges of satisfying parametric assumptions in genomic settings with thousands or millions of tests have led investigators to combine powerful False Discovery Rate (FDR) approaches with computationally expensive but exact permutation testing. We describe a computationally efficient permutation-based approach that includes a tractable estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses, the variance of the log of tail-area FDR, and a confidence interval (CI) estimator, which accounts for the number of permutations conducted and dependencies between tests. The CI estimator applies a binomial distribution and an overdispersion parameter to counts of positive tests. The approach is general with regards to the distribution of the test statistic, it performs favorably in comparison to other approaches, and reliable FDR estimates are demonstrated with as few as 10 permutations. An application of this approach to relate sleep patterns to gene expression patterns in mouse hypothalamus yielded a set of 11 transcripts associated with 24 h REM sleep [FDR = 0.15 (0.08, 0.26)]. Two of the corresponding genes, Sfrp1 and Sfrp4, are involved in wnt signaling and several others, Irf7, Ifit1, Iigp2, and Ifih1, have links to interferon signaling. These genes would have been overlooked had a typical a priori FDR threshold such as 0.05 or 0.1 been applied. The CI provides the flexibility for choosing a significance threshold based on tolerance for false discoveries and precision of the FDR estimate. That is, it frees the investigator to use a more data-driven approach to define significance, such as the minimum estimated FDR, an option that is especially useful for weak effects, often observed in studies of complex diseases.},

The striking findings and the scope of the United Church of Christ study suggest that environmental racism is not confined to hazardous waste alone. The multivariate analysis is also used to weigh the relative strength of the relationship of race and income with the distribution of sites.

The hyperbolic space is the only space that can successfully embed the tree-like nature of the hierarchy.

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the heart and blood vessels constituting a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Cardiovascular drug development aims to deliver efficacious drugs to address the public health burden of cardiovascular diseases. However, the high costs associated with cardiovascular drug development, for example due to long-running clinical trials, sometimes including thousands of patients, place a high burden on the development of new efficacious treatments for cardiovascular diseases. Proposals for improving the efficiency of cardiovascular drug development include better disease characterization, more defined target populations, and the use of adaptive clinical trial designs. This dissertation focuses on adaptive clinical trial designs for cardiovascular research.},

  abstract = {A prespecified set of genes may be enriched, to varying degrees, for genes that have altered expression levels relative to two or more states of a cell. Knowing the enrichment of gene sets defined by functional categories, such as gene ontology (GO) annotations, is valuable for analyzing the biological signals in microarray expression data. A common approach to measuring enrichment is by cross-classifying genes according to membership in a functional category and membership on a selected list of significantly altered genes. A small Fisher's exact test \$p\$-value, for example, in this \$2\textbackslash times2\$ table is indicative of enrichment. Other category analysis methods retain the quantitative gene-level scores and measure significance by referring a category-level statistic to a permutation distribution associated with the original differential expression problem. We describe a class of random-set scoring methods that measure distinct components of the enrichment signal. The class includes Fisher's test based on selected genes and also tests that average gene-level evidence across the category. Averaging and selection methods are compared empirically using Affymetrix data on expression in nasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and theoretically using a location model of differential expression. We find that each method has a domain of superiority in the state space of enrichment problems, and that both methods have benefits in practice. Our analysis also addresses two problems related to multiple-category inference, namely, that equally enriched categories are not detected with equal probability if they are of different sizes, and also that there is dependence among category statistics owing to shared genes. Random-set enrichment calculations do not require Monte Carlo for implementation. They are made available in the R package allez.},

One of the most prominent directions has been the extensive set of studies on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), namely, the discovery of genetic variants that explain variation in gene expression levels. Such studies have offered promise not just for the characterization of functional sequence variation but also for the understanding of basic processes of gene regulation and interpretation of genome-wide association studies. In this review, we discuss some of the key directions of eQTL research and its implications.},

However, state-of-the-art embedding methods typically do not account for latent hierarchical structures which are characteristic for many complex symbolic datasets. In this work, we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincar\'e ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity. We present an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar\'e embeddings can outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies, both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.},

  abstract = {Gene isoforms are mRNAs that are produced from the same locus but are different in their transcription start sites (TSSs), protein coding DNA sequences (CDSs) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs), potentially altering gene function. Cis-regulatory elements in the promoter contain sequences recognized by transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. So the location of the TSS is important for understanding the biogenesis of specific isoforms. The idea that different binding partners confer different functional properties has been well studied in tissue-specific gene regulation. For example, the same transcription factor (TF) can direct gene expression in different tissues simply by binding with different TSSs in each tissue. Isoforms harboring changes in the CDS have been the most thoroughly characterized because they commonly give rise to proteins with different functional properties. UTRs regulate the levels of primary transcript in numerous ways: transcript stability, folding and turnover, as well as translation efficiency. UTRs are often the target of miRNA, which typically downregulate transcript expression by triggering degradation or halting translation.The gene isoforms can be sequenced by Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Recently some progress has been made to characterize known isoforms of regeneration associated genes (RAGs) using RNA-Seq, which is important in understanding the isoform diversity in the CNS.},

We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes {$>$}99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of {$>$}1\% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies., Results for the final phase of the 1000 Genomes Project are presented including whole-genome sequencing, targeted exome sequencing, and genotyping on high-density SNP arrays for 2,504 individuals across 26 populations, providing a global reference data set to support biomedical genetics., The 1000 Genomes Project has sought to comprehensively catalogue human genetic variation across populations, providing a valuable public genomic resource. The data obtained so far have found applications ranging from association studies and fine mapping studies to the filtering of likely neutral variants in rare-disease cohorts. The authors now report on the final phase of the project, phase 3, which covers previously uncharacterized areas of human genetic diversity in terms of the populations sampled and categories of characterized variation. The sample now includes more than 2,500 individuals from 26 global populations, with low coverage whole-genome and deep exome sequencing, as well as dense microarray genotyping. They find that while most common variants are shared across populations, rarer variants are often restricted to closely related populations. The authors also demonstrate the use of the phase 3 dataset as a reference panel for imputation to improve the resolution in genetic association studies.},

  abstract = {In biology, histones are highly basic proteins abundant in lysine and arginine residues that are found in eukaryotic cell nuclei. They act as spools around which DNA winds to create structural units called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes in turn are wrapped into 30-nanometer fibers that form tightly packed chromatin. Histones prevent DNA from becoming tangled and protect it from DNA damage.  In addition, histones play important roles in gene regulation and DNA replication. Without histones, unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long. For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA if completely stretched out; however, when wound about histones, this length is reduced to about 90 micrometers (0.09 mm) of 30 nm diameter chromatin fibers.There are five families of histones which are designated H1/H5 (linker histones), H2, H3, and H4 (core histones).  The nucleosome core is formed of two H2A-H2B dimers and a H3-H4 tetramer.  The tight wrapping of DNA around histones is to a large degree a result of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged histones and negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. Histones may be chemically modified through the action of enzymes to regulate gene transcription.  The most common modification are the methylation of arginine or lysine residues or the acetylation of lysine.  Methylation can affect how other protein such as transcription factors interact with the nucleosomes.  Lysine acetylation eliminates a positive charge on lysine thereby weakening the electrostatic attraction between histone and DNA resulting in partial unwinding of the DNA making it more accessible for gene expression.},

  abstract = {Through characterising the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help understand the genetic contribution to disease. We describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methodologies to integrate information across multiple algorithms and diverse data sources we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million indels and over 14 thousand larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways and that each individual harbours hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as transcription-factor-motif disrupting changes. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible SNPs at a frequency of 1\% in populations of medical genetics focus, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

They play a surprising role in heritability since MAF variants which occur only once, known as "singletons", drive an enormous amount of selection.Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 (5\%) or greater were targeted by the HapMap project.MAF is widely used in population genetics studies because it provides information to differentiate between common and rare variants in the population. As an example, a 2015 study sequenced the whole genomes of 2,120 Sardinian individuals. The authors classified the variants found in the study in three classes according to their MAF. It was observed that rare variants (MAF {$<$} 0.05) appeared more frequently in coding regions than common variants (MAF {$>$} 0.05) in this population.},

The name alludes to the saying "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch", that is, there are no easy shortcuts to success. In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper "state[s] that any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems".The "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. See No free lunch in search and optimization for treatment of the research area. While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.},

  abstract = {A nucleosome is the basic structural unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes. The structure of a nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone proteins and resembles thread wrapped around a spool. The nucleosome is the fundamental subunit of chromatin. Each nucleosome is composed of a little less than two turns of DNA wrapped around a set of eight proteins called histones, which are known as a histone octamer. Each histone octamer is composed of two copies each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. DNA must be compacted into nucleosomes to fit within the cell nucleus. In addition to nucleosome wrapping, eukaryotic chromatin is further compacted by being folded into a series of more complex structures, eventually forming a chromosome. Each human cell contains about 30 million nucleosomes.Nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information in the form of covalent modifications of their core histones. Nucleosome positions in the genome are not random, and it is important to know where each nucleosome is located because this determines the accessibility of the DNA to regulatory proteins.Nucleosomes were first observed as particles in the electron microscope by Don and Ada Olins in 1974, and their existence and structure (as histone octamers surrounded by approximately 200 base pairs of DNA) were proposed by Roger Kornberg. The role of the nucleosome as a regulator of transcription was demonstrated by Lorch et al. in vitro in 1987 and by Han and Grunstein and Clark-Adams et al. in vivo in 1988. The nucleosome core particle consists of approximately 146 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped in 1.67 left-handed superhelical turns around a histone octamer, consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Core particles are connected by stretches of linker DNA, which can be up to about 80 bp long. Technically, a nucleosome is defined as the core particle plus one of these linker regions; however the word is often synonymous with the core particle. Genome-wide nucleosome positioning maps are now available for many model organisms including mouse liver and brain.Linker histones such as H1 and its isoforms are involved in chromatin compaction and sit at the base of the nucleosome near the DNA entry and exit binding to the linker region of the DNA. Non-condensed nucleosomes without the linker histone resemble "beads on a string of DNA" under an electron microscope.In contrast to most eukaryotic cells, mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio. Histone equivalents and a simplified chromatin structure have also been found in Archaea, suggesting that eukaryotes are not the only organisms that use nucleosomes.},

  abstract = {In Bayesian statistical inference, a prior probability distribution, often simply called the prior, of an uncertain quantity is the probability distribution that would express one's beliefs about this quantity before some evidence is taken into account. For example, the prior could be the probability distribution representing the relative proportions of voters who will vote for a particular politician in a future election. The unknown quantity may be a parameter of the model or a latent variable rather than an observable variable. Bayes' theorem calculates the renormalized pointwise product of the prior and the likelihood function, to produce the posterior probability distribution, which is the conditional distribution of the uncertain quantity given the data. Similarly, the prior probability of a random event or an uncertain proposition is the unconditional probability that is assigned before any relevant evidence is taken into account. Priors can be created using a number of methods.:{$\mkern1mu$}27\textendash 41{$\mkern1mu$} A prior can be determined from past information, such as previous experiments. A prior can be elicited from the purely subjective assessment of an experienced expert. An uninformative prior can be created to reflect a balance among outcomes when no information is available. Priors can also be chosen according to some principle, such as symmetry or maximizing entropy given constraints; examples are the Jeffreys prior or Bernardo's reference prior.  When a family of  conjugate priors exists, choosing a prior from that family simplifies calculation of the posterior distribution. Parameters of prior distributions are a kind of hyperparameter. For example, if one uses a beta distribution to model the distribution of the parameter p of a Bernoulli distribution, then: p is a parameter of the underlying system (Bernoulli distribution), and {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} are parameters of the prior distribution (beta distribution); hence hyperparameters.Hyperparameters themselves may have hyperprior distributions expressing beliefs about their values. A Bayesian model with more than one level of prior like this is called a hierarchical Bayes model.},

  title = {Supplement {{S1}}: {{Finite-sample}} Results for {{FDR}} Control of {{IHW}}},
  abstract = {Throughout Supplementary Section S1, the weights W i are considered random. Occasionally we explicitly condition on the weights; in which case we verify how the conditioning on (subsets of) weights influences conditional distributions. S1.1 A preliminary lemma They key property of IHW that enables finite-sample type-I error control is the following: cross-weighting makes the p-values and their weights independent of each other. This was already demonstrated in the beginning of the proof of Theorem 3 in Section 3.2. Here we formalize this result through the following Lemma: Lemma 1. Let (W i) i2[m] be honest weights (Specification 1) w.r.t. the partition I 1 ,. .. , I K of [m]. If ((P i , X i)) i2[m] satisfy Assumption 2, then: (a) For al\`i 2 [K] and all i 2 H 0 \textbackslash{} I ` , P i is independent of (W k) k2I`.k2I`k2I`. In particular P i is independent of W i (P i ? W i) for all i 2 H 0. The conclusion may be strengthened if instead ((P i , X i)) i2[m] satisfy Assumption 1: (a') For al\`i 2 [K], (P i) i2H0\textbackslash I\`isi2H0\textbackslash I\`is independent of (W i) i2H0\textbackslash I`.i2H0\textbackslash I`i2H0\textbackslash I`. (b') For al\`i 2 [K], (P i) i2H0\textbackslash I\`arei2H0\textbackslash I\`are jointly independent and super-uniform conditionally on (W i) i2H0\textbackslash I`.i2H0\textbackslash I`i2H0\textbackslash I`. Proof. We prove (a); the other statements follow similarly. Fix`2Fix`Fix`2 [K] and let i 2 H 0 \textbackslash{} I `. By definition of honesty (Specification 1), (W k) k2I\`isk2I\`is a function only of (P i) i2I c ` and X = (X i) i2[m]. It thus suffices to argue that P i is independent of ((P i) i2I c ` , X). Writing the latter as ((P i) i2I c ` , (X i) i2I c ` , (X i) i2I`)i2I`i2I`) we conclude as a consequence of parts (a) and (b) of Assumption 2. S1.2 The IHW-BH procedure under independence: Proof of Theorem 1 Proof. Let W be the weights and\textasciicircum kand\textasciicircum{} and\textasciicircum k the number of discoveries after applying IHW-BH at level {$\carriagereturn$} and with censoring level ⌧. Also write X = (X 1 ,. .. , X m), P = (P 1 ,. .. , P m) and 1(P  ⌧) = (1(P 1  ⌧),. .. , 1(P m  ⌧)). Here 1(P i  ⌧) is the indicator function that is 1 when P i  ⌧ and 0 otherwise. We first give a high level idea regarding the proof. To bound the FDR we seek to bound expectations of 1(H i rejected)/(\textasciicircum{} k \_ 1), i.e., of 1(P i  {$\carriagereturn$}W i \textasciicircum{} k/m, P i  ⌧)/(\textasciicircum{} k \_ 1) where i is null. 9 If W i , \textasciicircum{} k were independent of P i , then we could directly upper bound this expectation by E[({$\carriagereturn$}W i \textasciicircum{} k/m)/(\textasciicircum{} k \_ 1)]  E[{$\carriagereturn$}W i /m] from which FDR control would follow by summing over all i. Honesty (Specification 1) makes-in the way of Lemma 1-P i and its weight W i (for a single null i) independent. However, P i directly influences\textasciicircum kinfluences\textasciicircum{} influences\textasciicircum k. This is true also for unweighted BH and weighted BH with deterministic weights, yet here P i also indirectly influences\textasciicircum kinfluences\textasciicircum{} influences\textasciicircum k through the weights W j , j 6 = i. Nevertheless, we will argue that the conclusion may still be salvaged: ⌧-censoring (Specification 2) ensures that on the event \{P i  ⌧ \} the exact value of P i cannot influence weights W j , j 6 = i. Furthermore, it suffices to only consider the event \{P i  ⌧ \} (in turn for each null i), since i will never get rejected when P i {$>$} ⌧ (by Definition 2). We make the above intuition rigorous using a leave-one-out argument as in the proof idea of Li and Barber [2019]. Let us first pay attention to a single index i 2 [m]. We denote by k i the number of discoveries of IHW-BH if P gets replaced by P i7 !0 = (P 1 ,. .. , P i1 , 0, P i+1 , P m). Note that because the weights are ⌧-censored (Specification 2) , the tuple of weights W remains unchanged by replacing P i by 0 on the event \{P i  ⌧ \}. Furthermore, by definition of the ⌧-censored weighted BH procedure (Definition 2), the rejection of H i (by IHW-BH applied to P) implies that 9 We use the notation a \_ b = max \{a, b\}, a \^ b = min \{a, b\}.

Cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) binding induces global domain movements of the 30               S               subunit and changes in the conformation of the universally conserved and essential bases A1492, A1493, and G530 of 16               S               RNA. These bases interact intimately with the minor groove of the first two base pairs between the codon and anticodon, thus sensing Watson-Crick base-pairing geometry and discriminating against near-cognate tRNA. The third, or ``wobble,'' position of the codon is free to accommodate certain noncanonical base pairs. By partially inducing these structural changes, paromomycin facilitates binding of near-cognate tRNAs.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in the human transcriptome are widespread and tissue specific, and they contribute to complex traits.           ,              The role of sex in the human transcriptome                            In humans, the inheritance of the XX or XY set of sex chromosomes is responsible for most individuals developing into adults expressing male or female sex-specific traits. However, the degree to which sex-biased gene expression occurs in tissues, especially those that do not contribute to characteristic sexually dimorphic traits. is unknown. Oliva               et al.               examined Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data and found that 37\% of genes in at least one of the 44 tissues studied exhibit a tissue-specific, sex-biased gene expression. They also identified a sex-specific variation in cellular composition across tissues. Overall, the effects of sex on gene expression were small, but they were genome-wide and mostly mediated through transcription factor binding. With sex-biased gene expression associated with loci identified in genome-wide association studies, this study lays the groundwork for identifying the molecular basis of male- and female-based diseases.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaba3066                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               Many complex human phenotypes, including diseases, exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. These sex differences have been variously attributed to hormones, sex chromosomes, genotype \texttimes{} sex effects, differences in behavior, and differences in environmental exposures; however, their mechanisms and underlying biology remain largely unknown. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides an opportunity to investigate the prevalence and genetic mechanisms of sex differences in the human transcriptome by surveying many tissues that have not previously been characterized in this manner.                                         RATIONALE               To characterize sex differences in the human transcriptome and its regulation, and to discover how sex and genetics interact to influence complex traits and disease, we generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and its genetic regulation across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the GTEx project (v8 data release), analyzing 16,245 RNA-sequencing samples and genotypes of 838 adult individuals. We report sex differences in gene expression levels, tissue cell type composition, and cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). To assess their impact, we integrated these results with gene function, transcription factor binding annotation, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 87 GWASs.                                         RESULTS                                Sex effects on gene expression are ubiquitous (13,294 sex-biased genes across all tissues). However, these effects are small and largely tissue-specific. Genes with sex-differentiated expression are not primarily driven by tissue-specific gene expression and are involved in a diverse set of biological functions, such as drug and hormone response, embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis, fertilization, sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis, fat metabolism, cancer, and immune response. Whereas X-linked genes with higher expression in females suggest candidates for escape from X-chromosome inactivation, sex-biased expression of autosomal genes suggests hormone-related transcription factor regulation and a role for additional transcription factors, as well as sex-differentiated distribution of epigenetic marks, particularly histone H3 Lys                 27                 trimethylation (H3K27me3).                              Sex differences in the genetic regulation of gene expression are much less common (369 sex-biased eQTLs across all tissues) and are highly tissue-specific. We identified 58 gene-trait associations driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These include loci where sex-differentiated cell type abundances mediate genotype-phenotype associations, as well as loci where sex may play a more direct role in the underlying molecular mechanism of the association. For example, we identified a female-specific eQTL in liver for the hexokinase HKDC1 that influences glucose metabolism in pregnant females, which is subsequently reflected in the birth weight of the offspring.                                         CONCLUSION               By integrating sex-aware analyses of GTEx data with gene function and transcription factor binding annotations, we describe tissue-specific and tissue-shared drivers and mechanisms contributing to sex differences in the human transcriptome and eQTLs. We discovered multiple sex-differentiated genetic effects on gene expression that colocalize with complex trait genetic associations, thereby facilitating the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS signals. Because the causative tissue is unknown for many phenotypes, analysis of the diverse GTEx tissue collection can serve as a powerful resource for investigations into the basis of sex-biased traits. This work provides an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.                                                   Sex affects gene expression and its genetic regulation across tissues.                   Sex effects on gene expression were measured in 44 GTEx human tissue sources and integrated with genotypes of 838 subjects. Sex-biased expression is present in numerous biological pathways and is associated to sex-differentiated transcriptional regulation. Sex-biased expression quantitative trait loci in cis (sex-biased eQTLs) are partially mediated by cellular abundances and reveal gene-trait associations. TT, AT, and AA are genotypes for a single-nucleotide polymorphism; TF, transcription factor.                                                                         ,              Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37\% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matters less than 2.5\,\textmu m (PM2.5) in the ambient atmosphere are strongly associated with adverse health effects. However, it is unlikely that all fine particles are equally toxic in view of their different sizes and chemical components. Toxicity of fine particles produced from various combustion sources (diesel engine, gasoline engine, biomass burning (rice straw and pine stem burning), and coal combustion) and non-combustion sources (road dust including sea spray aerosols, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOA)), which are known major sources of PM2.5, was determined. Multiple biological and chemical endpoints were integrated for various source-specific aerosols to derive toxicity scores for particles originating from different sources. The highest toxicity score was obtained for diesel engine exhaust particles, followed by gasoline engine exhaust particles, biomass burning particles, coal combustion particles, and road dust, suggesting that traffic plays the most critical role in enhancing the toxic effects of fine particles. The toxicity ranking of fine particles produced from various sources can be used to better understand the adverse health effects caused by different fine particle types in the ambient atmosphere, and to provide practical management of fine particles beyond what can be achieved only using PM mass which is the current regulation standard.},

To explore how well the hierarchical structure of unlabeled data can be represented in hyperbolic spaces, we design a novel hyperbolic message passing auto-encoder whose overall auto-encoding is performed in hyperbolic space. The proposed model conducts auto-encoding the networks via fully utilizing hyperbolic geometry in message passing. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we validate the properties and benefits of the unsupervised hyperbolic representations.

However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals between PM2.5 (per 10 \textmu g/m3) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM2.5-mortality association by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Overall, 65\,936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22\,152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM2.5 and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08\textendash 1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06\textendash 1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Using a nationally representative sample, the association between PM2.5 and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for nonHispanic white adults.},

Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},

Standard random forests, however, do not efficiently handle functional data and runs into a curse-of dimensionality when presented with high-resolution curves and surfaces. Furthermore, in settings with heteroskedasticity or multimodality, a regression point estimate with standard errors do not fully capture the uncertainty in our predictions. A more informative quantity is the conditional density p(y | x) which describes the full extent of the uncertainty in the response y given covariates x. In this paper we show how random forests can be efficiently leveraged for conditional density estimation, functional covariates, and multiple responses without increasing computational complexity. We provide open-source software for all procedures with R and Python versions that call a common C++ library.},

  abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci\textemdash e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

Almost all computational algorithms developed for single-cell RNA-seq adopted gene selection, dimension reduction or imputation to address the dropouts. Here, an opposite view is explored. Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal. We represent the dropout pattern by binarizing single-cell RNA-seq count data, and present a co-occurrence clustering algorithm to cluster cells based on the dropout pattern. We demonstrate in multiple published datasets that the binary dropout pattern is as informative as the quantitative expression of highly variable genes for the purpose of identifying cell types. We expect that recognizing the utility of dropouts provides an alternative direction for developing computational algorithms for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.},

Spateo delivers novel methods for digitizing spatial layers/columns to identify spatially-polar genes, and develops a comprehensive framework of cell-cell interaction to reveal spatial effects of niche factors and cell type-specific ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, Spateo reconstructs 3D models of whole embryos, and performs 3D morphometric analyses. Lastly, Spateo introduces the concept of "morphometric vector field" of cell migrations, and integrates spatial differential geometry to unveil regulatory programs underlying various organogenesis patterns of Drosophila. Thus, Spateo enables the study of the ecology of organs at a molecular level in 3D space, beyond isolated single cells.},

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the nai\`Ive application of the linear step-up procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation. Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the nai\`Ive one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDR control. \textcopyright{} Oxford University Press 2001.},

Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations.

This report also includes a technical discussion of direct and indirect standardization and statistical variability in age-adjusted death rates. Currently, at least three different standards are used among Department of Health and Human Services agencies. Implementation of the year 2000 standard will reduce confusion among data users and the burden on State and local agencies. Use of the year 2000 standard will also result in age-adjusted death rates that are substantially larger than those based on the 1940 standard. Further, the new standard will affect trends in age-adjusted death rates for certain causes of death and will narrow race differentials in age-adjusted death rates. Although age standardization is an important and useful tool, it has some limitations. As a result the examination of age-adjusted death rates should be the beginning of an analysis strategy.},

Supplemental content CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning and CME Questions page 779 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Serial cross-sectional study of 4 690 729 deaths recorded in the US National Vital Statistics System in 2010 and 2017. EXPOSURES Sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Life expectancy at age 25 years and years of life lost between ages 25 and 84 years by cause of death. RESULTS The analysis included a total of 2 211 633 deaths in 2010 and 2 479 096 deaths in 2017. Between 2010 and 2017, life expectancy at age 25 significantly declined among white and black non-Hispanic US residents from an expected age at death of 79.34 to 79.15 years (difference, -0.18 [95\% CI, -0.23 to -0.14]). Greater decreases were observed among persons with a high school degree or less (white men: -1.05 years [95\% CI, -1.15 to -0.94], white women: -1.14 years [95\% CI, -1.24 to -1.04], and black men: -0.30 years [95\% CI, -0.56 to -0.04]). White adults with some college education but no 4-year college degree experienced similar declines in life expectancy (men: -0.89 years [95\% CI, -1.07 to -0.73], women: -0.59 years [95\% CI, -0.77 to -0.42]). In contrast, life expectancy at age 25 significantly increased among the college-educated (white men: 0.58 years [95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.73], white women: 0.78 years [95\% CI, 0.57 to 1.00], and black women: 1.70 years [95\% CI, 0.91 to 2.53]). The difference between high- and low-education groups increased from 2010 to 2017, largely because life-years lost to drug use increased among those with a high school degree or less (white men: 0.93 years [95\% CI, 0.90 to 0.96], white women: 0.50 years [95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.52], black men: 0.75 years [95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.79], and black women: 0.28 years [95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.31]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this serial cross-sectional study, estimated life expectancy at age 25 years declined overall between 2010 and 2017; however, it declined among persons without a 4-year college degree and increased among college-educated persons. Much of the increasing educational differences in years of life lost may be related to deaths attributed to drug use.},

  abstract = {The educational gradient in life expectancy is well documented in the United States and in other low-mortality countries. Highly educated Americans, on average, live longer than their low-educated counterparts, who have recently seen declines in adult life expectancy. However, limiting the discussion on lifespan inequality to mean differences alone overlooks other dimensions of inequality and particularly disparities in lifespan variation. The latter represents a unique form of inequality, with higher variation translating into greater uncertainty in the time of death from an individual standpoint, and higher group heterogeneity from a population perspective. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System from 1990 to 2010, this is the first study to document trends in both life expectancy and S25\textemdash the standard deviation of age at death above 25\textemdash by educational attainment. Among low-educated whites, adult life expectancy declined by 3.1 years for women and by 0.6 years for men. At the same time, S25 increased by about 1.5 years among high school\textendash educated whites of both genders, becoming an increasingly important component of total lifespan inequality. By contrast, college-educated whites benefited from rising life expectancy and record low variation in age at death, consistent with the shifting mortality scenario. Among blacks, adult life expectancy increased, and S25 plateaued or declined in nearly all educational attainment groups, although blacks generally lagged behind whites of the same gender on both measures. Documenting trends in lifespan variation can therefore improve our understanding of lifespan inequality and point to diverging trajectories in adult mortality across socioeconomic strata.},

We analyze within a spatially explicit theoretical residential choice model how different urban interventions can reduce exposure to endogenous traffic-induced air pollution at residential locations. We model a city of fixed population size, where households are averse to localized pollution and examine how a flat commuting tax, an urban growth boundary, a cordon toll, and the optimal distance-based tax compare to an urban scenario without any planner's intervention. We find that an urban intervention to optimally address exposure concerns needs to achieve steep density gradients near the urban fringe and flat gradients near the center. We show the deficiencies of the alternative interventions to achieve optimal population distributions within the city and in a scenario where peoples' aversion to pollution increases. We then discuss these interventions in light of resulting spatial patterns of exposure and spatial equity that is households' assessment of their own exposure to air pollution relative to their responsibility for the exposure of others depending on their spatial location within the city. Our results show that, when equity is also a concern, compensations are needed from households who live in the periphery and our simulations suggest that a cordon toll can then achieve a more balanced outcome.},

This may partly be due to the low power of standard statistical approaches to detect gene\textendash gene and gene\textendash environment interactions when small marginal effects are present. A promising alternative is Random Forests, which have already been successfully applied in candidate gene analyses. Important single nucleotide polymorphisms are detected by permutation importance measures.

We identified definitively bivalent nucleosomes with concomitant repressive and activating marks, as well as other combinatorial modification states whose prevalence varies with developmental potency. We showed that genetic and chemical perturbations of chromatin enzymes preferentially affect nucleosomes harboring specific modification states. Last, we combined this proteomic platform with single-molecule DNA sequencing technology to simultaneously determine the modification states and genomic positions of individual nucleosomes. This single-molecule technology has the potential to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and epigenetic regulation.},

We develop methods that: (1) allow for sampling error in allele frequencies of candidate stocks, and (2) evaluate the possibility of unsampled contributing stocks. Composition analysis for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) collected for the Bonneville Dam egg bank program in 1980 and 1981 shows that about 10\% of both harvests were from the Deschutes River and about 90\% from the Hanford Reach area.

However, the lfdr is difficult to work with in small samples, as the prior distribution is typically unknown. We propose a simple multiple testing procedure and prove that it controls the expectation of the maximum lfdr across all rejections; equivalently, it controls the probability that the rejection with the largest p-value is a false discovery. Our method operates without knowledge of the prior, assuming only that the p-value density is uniform under the null and decreasing under the alternative. We also show that our method asymptotically implements the oracle Bayes procedure for a weighted classification risk, optimally trading off between false positives and false negatives. We derive the limiting distribution of the attained maximum lfdr over the rejections, and the limiting empirical Bayes regret relative to the oracle procedure.},

Common practice by U.S. federal agencies involves using underlying health data and concentration\textendash response functions that are not differentiated by racial/ethnic group. Objectives: We aim to explore the policy implications of using race/ethnicity-specific concentration\textendash response functions and mortality data in comparison to standard approaches when estimating the impact of air pollution on non-White racial/ethnic subgroups. Methods: Using new estimates from the epidemiological literature on race/ethnicity-specific concentration\textendash response functions paired with race/ethnicity-specific mortality rates, we estimated the mortality impacts of air pollution from all sources from a uniform increase in concentrations and from the regulations imposed by the Mercury Air Toxics Standards. Results: Use of race/ethnicity-specific information increased PM 2.5 -related PM2.5-related premature mortality estimates in older populations by 9\% and among older Black Americans by 150\% for all-source pollution exposure. Under a uniform degradation of air quality and race/ethnicity-specific information, older Black Americans were found to have approximately 3 times higher mortality relative to White Americans, which is obscured under a non\textendash race/ethnicity-specific modeling approach. Standard approaches of using non\textendash racial/ethnic specific information underestimate the benefits of the Mercury Air Toxics Standards to older Black Americans by almost 60\% and overestimate the benefits to older White Americans by 14\% relative to using a race/ethnicity-specific modeling approach. Discussion: Policy analyses incorporating race/ethnicity-specific concentration\textendash response functions and mortality data relative to nondifferentiated inputs underestimate the overall magnitude of PM 2.5 PM2.5 mortality burden and the disparity in impacts on older Black American populations. Based on our results, we recommend that the best available race/ethnicity-specific inputs are used in regulatory assessments to understand and reduce environmental injustices. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9001}

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach\textemdash we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini\textendash Hochberg FDR method.},

  abstract = {The false discovery rate (FDR) is a multiple hypothesis testing quantity that describes the expected proportion of false positive results among all rejected null hypotheses. Benjamini and Hochberg introduced this quantity and proved that a particular step-up p-value method controls the FDR. Storey introduced a point estimate of the FDR for fixed significance regions. The former approach conservatively controls the FDR at a fixed predetermined level, and the latter provides a conservatively biased estimate of the FDR for a fixed predetermined significance region. In this work, we show in both finite sample and asymptotic settings that the goals of the two approaches are essentially equivalent. In particular, the FDR point estimates can be used to define valid FDR controlling procedures. In the asymptotic setting, we also show that the point estimates can be used to estimate the FDR conservatively over all significance regions simultaneously, which is equivalent to controlling the FDR at all levels simultaneously. The main tool that we use is to translate existing FDR methods into procedures involving empirical processes. This simplifies finite sample proofs, provides a framework for asymptotic results and proves that these procedures are valid even under certain forms of dependence.},

  abstract = {One key objective of the population health sciences is to understand why one social group has different levels of health and well-being compared with another. Whereas several methods have been developed in economics, sociology, demography, and epidemiology to answer these types of questions, a recent method introduced by Jackson and VanderWeele (2018) provided an update to decompositions by anchoring them within causal inference theory. In this paper, we demonstrate how to implement the causal decomposition using Monte Carlo integration and the parametric g-formula. Causal decomposition can help to identify the sources of differences across populations and provide researchers with a way to move beyond estimating inequalities to explaining them and determining what can be done to reduce health disparities. Our implementation approach can easily and flexibly be applied for different types of outcome and explanatory variables without having to derive decomposition equations. We describe the concepts of the approach and the practical steps and considerations needed to implement it. We then walk through a worked example in which we investigate the contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality in South Korea. For this example, we provide both pseudocode and R code using our package, cfdecomp. Ultimately, we outline how to implement a very general decomposition algorithm that is grounded in counterfactual theory but still easy to apply to a wide range of situations.},

Section of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disease of the lower limbs affecting approximately 8 to 10 million Americans. Diabetic patients are twice as likely to develop PAD than are patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and PAD progression is more rapid in DM patients. The primary goal of this study was to translate image analysis tools previously developed and validated for application to hybrid SPECT/CT imaging in preclinical models of peripheral arterial disease to patients, and to evaluate the reproducibility and feasibility of the approach for clinical imaging. Lower extremity tissue perfusion was analyzed in patients using 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT/CT imaging. Image analysis tools previously validated for murine and porcine models of hind limb ischemia were used to analyze and quantify specific lower extremity muscle groups in a pilot series of clinical SPECT/CT images. Using an image analysis program, the image quantification was done by drawing volumes of interest (VOIs) around each of five muscle groups in the calf (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, fibularis, soleus, and gastrocnemius) on the CT images. These ROIs were then copied onto the registered SPECT images to obtain an average intensity value for each muscle group an index of both microvascular and macrovascular perfusion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in intensity per volume per injected dose of radiotracer corrected for decay between rest and stress for all of the muscle groups between patients that had both rest and stress imaging (P=0.001). We demonstrated that our approach has a high interobserver reproducibility, with an R2 = 0.99 between the two sets of values. This method may be used to assess abnormality of both microvascular and macrovascular perfusion of patients with diabetes mellitus at higher risk for peripheral arterial disease in the future.},

Here, we link PM2.5 exposure to the human activities responsible for PM2.5 pollution. We use these results to explore ``pollution inequity'': the difference between the environmental health damage caused by a racial\textendash ethnic group and the damage that group experiences. We show that, in the United States, PM2.5 exposure is disproportionately caused by consumption of goods and services mainly by the non-Hispanic white majority, but disproportionately inhaled by black and Hispanic minorities. On average, non-Hispanic whites experience a ``pollution advantage'': They experience {$\sim$}17\% less air pollution exposure than is caused by their consumption. Blacks and Hispanics on average bear a ``pollution burden'' of 56\% and 63\% excess exposure, respectively, relative to the exposure caused by their consumption. The total disparity is caused as much by how much people consume as by how much pollution they breathe. Differences in the types of goods and services consumed by each group are less important. PM2.5 exposures declined {$\sim$}50\% during 2002\textendash 2015 for all three racial\textendash ethnic groups, but pollution inequity has remained high.},

However, some of these changes only occur in a small number of tissues within the body. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has been expanded over time, and, looking at the final data in version 8, Aguet               et al.               present a deep characterization of genetic associations and gene expression and splicing in 838 individuals over 49 tissues (see the Perspective by Wilson). This large study was able to characterize the details underlying many aspects of gene expression and provides a resource with which to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants affect gene regulation and complex traits in humans.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1318               ; see also p.               1298                        ,              The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations. Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.},

  abstract = {Electricity generation is a large contributor to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. However, the demographic distribution of the resulting exposure is largely unknown. We estimate exposures to and health impacts of PM2.5 from electricity generation in the US, for each of the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), for each US state, by income and by race. We find that average exposures are the highest for blacks, followed by non-Latino whites. Exposures for remaining groups (e.g., Asians, Native Americans, Latinos) are somewhat lower. Disparities by race/ethnicity are observed for each income category, indicating that the racial/ethnic differences hold even after accounting for differences in income. Levels of disparity differ by state and RTO. Exposures are higher for lower-income than for higher-income, but disparities are larger by race than by income. Geographically, we observe large differences between where electricity is generated and where people experience the resulting PM2.5 health consequences; some states are net exporters of health impacts, other are net importers. For 36 US states, most of the health impacts are attributable to emissions in other states. Most of the total impacts are attributable to coal rather than other fuels.},

  abstract = {Scientific writing, while an indispensable step of the scientific process, is often overlooked in undergraduate courses in favor of maximizing class time devoted to scientific concepts. However, the ability to effectively communicate research findings is crucial for success in the biological sciences. Graduate students are encouraged to publish early and often, and professional scientists are generally evaluated by the quantity of articles published and the number of citations those articles receive. It is therefore important that undergraduate students receive a solid foundation in scientific writing early in their academic careers. In order to increase the emphasis on effective writing in the classroom, we assembled a succinct step-b\- y-\- step guide to scientific writing that can be directly disseminated to undergraduates enrolled in biological science courses. The guide breaks down the scientific writing process into easily digestible pieces, providing concrete examples that students can refer to when preparing a scientific manuscript or laboratory report. By increasing undergraduate exposure to the scientific writing process, we hope to better prepare undergraduates for graduate school and productive careers in the biological sciences.},

These analyses are based on data drawn from the Master Beneficiary Record and NUMIDENT data files of the Social Security Administration. These data provide the first direct evidence regarding the effect of salmon bias on the Hispanic mortality advantage. Although we confirm the existence of salmon bias, it is of too small a magnitude to be a primary explanation for the lower mortality of Hispanic than NH white primary social security beneficiaries. Longitudinal surveys that follow individuals in and out of the United States are needed to further explore the role of migration in the health and mortality of foreign-born US residents and factors that contribute to the Hispanic mortality paradox.},

The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},

Here we describe the release of exome-sequence data for the first 49,960~study participants, revealing approximately 4~million coding variants (of which around 98.6\% have a frequency of less than 1\%). The data include 198,269 autosomal predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants, a more than 14-fold increase compared to the imputed sequence. Nearly all genes (more than 97\%) had at least one carrier with a LOF variant, and most genes (more than 69\%) had at least ten carriers with a LOF variant. We illustrate the power of characterizing LOF variants in this population through association analyses across 1,730~phenotypes. In addition to replicating established associations, we found novel LOF variants with large effects on disease traits, including               PIEZO1               on varicose veins,               COL6A1               on corneal resistance,               MEPE               on bone density, and               IQGAP2               and               GMPR               on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical importance, and show that 2\% of this population has a medically actionable variant. Furthermore, we characterize the penetrance of cancer in carriers of pathogenic               BRCA1               and               BRCA2               variants.

When adjustment is also made for adult socioeconomic status, we note how the overall disparity can be decomposed into the portion that would be eliminated by equalizing adult socioeconomic status across racial groups and the portion of the disparity that would remain even if adult socioeconomic status across racial groups were equalized. We also discuss a stronger interpretation of the ``effect of race'' involving the joint effects of skin color, parental skin color, genetic background and cultural context when such variables are thought to be hypothetically manipulable and if adequate control for confounding were possible. We discuss some of the challenges with such an interpretation. Further discussion is given as to how the use of selected populations in examining racial disparities can additionally complicate the interpretation of the effects.},

However, the methods from the causal inference literature have themselves been subject to a major limitation in that the so-called natural direct and indirect effects that are employed are not identified from data whenever there is a variable that is affected by the exposure, which also confounds the relationship between the mediator and the outcome. In this paper we describe three alternative approaches to effect decomposition that give quantities that can be interpreted as direct and indirect effects, and that can be identified from data even in the presence of an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder. We describe a simple weighting-based estimation method for each of these three approaches, illustrated with data from perinatal epidemiology. The methods described here can shed insight into pathways and questions of mediation even when an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder is present.},

Part of trying to understand biological processes and systems is therefore to confront our ideas and hypotheses with data using statistical methods to determine the extent to which our hypotheses agree with reality. But doing so in a systematic way is becoming increasingly challenging as our hypotheses become more detailed, and our data becomes more complex. Mathematical methods are therefore gaining in importance across the life- and biomedical sciences. Mathematical models allow us to test our understanding, make testable predictions about future behaviour, and gain insights into how we can control the behaviour of biological systems. It has been argued that mathematical methods can be of great benefit to biologists to make sense of data. But mathematics and mathematicians are set to benefit equally from considering the often bewildering complexity inherent to living systems. Here we present a small selection of open problems and challenges in mathematical biology. We have chosen these open problems because they are of both biological and mathematical interest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter ({$\leq$} 2.5\,{$\mu$}g/m3 in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) is significantly associated with increased risk of premature mortality. Our goal was to provide an updated meta-analysis of all-cause and cause-specific mortality associated with exposure to PM2.5 and to better estimate the risk of death as a function of air pollution levels. METHODS: We systematically searched all published cohort studies examining the association between long term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality. We applied multivariate linear random effects meta-analysis with random effects for cohort, and study within cohort. Meta-regression techniques were used to test whether study population or analytic characteristics modify the PM2.5 -mortality association and to estimate the shape of the concentration-response curve. RESULTS: A total of 53 studies that provided 135 estimates of the quantitative association between the risk of mortality and exposure to PM2.5 were included in the meta-analysis. There were 39 studies from North America, 8 from Europe, and 6 from Asia. Since 2015, 17 studies of long-term air pollution exposure have been published, covering, wider geographic areas with a wider range of mean exposures (e.g. {$<$}12 or {$>$} 20\,{$\mu$}g/m3). A penalized spline showed the slope decreased at higher concentrations but appeared to level off. We found that the inverse transform of average PM2.5 well approximated that spline and provided a parametric estimate that fit better than a linear or logarithmic term for average PM2.5. In addition, we found that studies using space time exposure models or fixed monitors at Zip-code scale (as compared to land use regression method), or additionally controlling for area level socio-economic status, or with mean exposure less than 10\,{$\mu$}g/m3 were associated with higher mortality effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides strong evidence for the adverse effect of PM2.5 on mortality, that studies with poorer exposure have lower effect size estimates, that more control for SES increases effect size estimates, and that significant effects are seen below 10\,\textmu g/m3. The concentration -response function produced here can be further applied in the global health risk assessment of air particulate matter.},

These approaches typically examine whether a group of related genes in the same functional pathway are jointly associated with a trait of interest.

  abstract = {Background: The shape of the exposure-response curve for long-term ambient fine particulate (PM2.5) exposure and cause-specific mortality is poorly understood, especially for rural populations and underrepresented minorities. Methods: We used hybrid machine learning and Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association of longterm PM2.5 exposures on specific causes of death for 53 million U.S. Medicare beneficiaries (aged {$\geq$}65) from 2000 to 2008. Models included strata for age, sex, race, and ZIP code and controlled for neighborhood socio-economic status (SES) in our main analyses, with approximately 4 billion person-months of follow-up, and additionally for warm season average of 1-h daily maximum ozone exposures in a sensitivity analysis. The impact of non-traffic PM2.5 on mortality was examined using two stage models of PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Results: A 10 {$\mu$}g /m3 increase in 12-month average PM2.5 prior to death was associated with a 5\% increase in allcause mortality, as well as an 8.8, 5.6, and 2.5\% increase in all cardiovascular disease (CVD)-, all respiratory-, and all cancer deaths, respectively, in age, gender, race, ZIP code, and SES-adjusted models. PM2.5 exposures, however, were not associated with lung cancer mortality. Results were not sensitive to control for ozone exposures. PM2.5mortality associations for CVD- and respiratory-related causes were positive and significant for beneficiaries irrespective of their sex, race, age, SES and urbanicity, with no evidence of a lower threshold for response or of lower Risk Ratios (RRs) at low PM2.5 levels. Associations between PM2.5 and CVD and respiratory mortality were linear and were higher for younger, Black and urban beneficiaries, but were largely similar by SES. Risks associated with non-traffic PM2.5 were lower than that for all PM2.5 and were null for respiratory and lung cancer-related deaths. Conclusions: PM2.5 was associated with mortality from CVD, respiratory, and all cancer, but not lung cancer. PM2.5associated risks of CVD and respiratory mortality were similar across PM2.5 levels, with no evidence of a threshold. Blacks, urban, and younger beneficiaries were most vulnerable to the long-term impacts of PM2.5 on mortality.},

We predicted annual average of PM2.5 in each zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) using a hybrid spatiotemporal model. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between long-term PM2.5 and mortality. We tested effect modification by individual-level covariates (race, sex, eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid, and medical history), neighborhood-level covariates (urbanicity, percentage below poverty level, lower education, median income, and median home value), mean summer temperature, and mass fraction of 11 PM2.5 components. Results\textemdash The hazard ratio (HR) for death was 1.021 (95\% confidence interval: 1.019\textendash 1.022) per one {$\mu$}g m-3 increase in annual PM2.5. The HR decreased with age. It was higher among males, non-whites, dual-eligible individuals, and beneficiaries with previous hospital admissions. It was higher in neighborhoods with lower SES or higher urbanicity. The HR increased with mean summer temperature. The risk associated with PM2.5 increased with relative concentration of elemental carbon, vanadium, copper, calcium, and iron and decreased with nitrate, organic carbon, and sulfate.

Yet, our understanding of the concentration-response relationship between outdoor PM2.5 and mortality in this range of near-background concentrations remains incomplete. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 7.1 million adults in one of the world's lowest exposure environments. Our findings reveal a supralinear concentration-response relationship between outdoor PM2.5 and mortality at very low ({$<$}5 {$\mu$}g/m3) concentrations. Our updated global concentration-response function incorporating this new information suggests an additional 1.5 million deaths globally attributable to outdoor PM2.5 annually compared to previous estimates. The global health benefits of meeting the new WHO guideline for outdoor PM2.5 are greater than previously assumed and indicate a need for continued reductions in outdoor air pollution around the world.}

Using five distinct approaches, we found that a decrease in PM2.5 (by 10 micrograms per cubic meter) leads to a statistically significant 6 to 7\% decrease in mortality risk. Based on these models, lowering the air quality standard to 10 micrograms per cubic meter would save 143,257 lives (95\% confidence interval, 115,581 to 170,645) in one decade.

However, the mathematical structure behind the Hessian spectra is still under-explored. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the Hessian spectra of well-trained deep neural networks exhibit simple power-law structures. Inspired by the statistical physics theories, we provide a maximum-entropy theoretical interpretation for explaining why the power-law structure exists.

GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the WeisfeilerLehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

We applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to assess the associations between daily PM2.5 exposure and YLL from respiratory diseases in 96 Chinese cities during 2013\textendash 2016. We further estimated the avoidable YLL, potential gains in life expectancy, and the attributable fraction by assuming daily PM2.5 concentration decrease to the air quality standards of China and World Health Organization.

Each 10 {$\mu$}g/m3 increase of PM2.5 in 3-day moving average (lag02) was associated with 0.16 (95\% CI: 0.08, 0.24) years increment in life expectancy from total respiratory diseases.

By attaining the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines, we estimated that an average of 782.09 (95\% CI: 438.29, 1125.89) YLLs caused by total respiratory death in each city could be avoided, which corresponded to 1.15\% (95\% CI: 0.67\%, 1.64\%) of the overall YLLs, and 0.12 (95\% CI: 0.07, 0.17) years increment in life expectancy. The results of COPD were generally consistent with total respiratory diseases. Our findings indicate that reduction in daily PM2.5 concentrations might lead to longer life expectancy from respiratory death.},

  abstract = {Large batch size training of Neural Networks has been shown to incur accuracy loss when trained with the current methods.  The exact underlying reasons for this are still not completely understood.  Here, we study large batch size training through the lens of the Hessian operator and robust optimization. In particular, we perform a Hessian based study to analyze exactly how the landscape of the loss function changes when training with large batch size. We compute the true Hessian spectrum, without approximation, by back-propagating the second derivative. Extensive experiments on multiple networks show that saddle-points are not the cause for generalization gap of large batch size training, and the results consistently show that large batch converges to points with noticeably higher Hessian spectrum. Furthermore, we show that robust training allows one to favor flat areas, as points with large Hessian spectrum show poor robustness to adversarial perturbation. We further study this relationship, and provide empirical and theoretical proof that the inner loop for robust training is a saddle-free optimization problem \textbackslash textit\{almost everywhere\}. We present detailed experiments with five different network architectures, including a residual network, tested on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 datasets.},

  abstract = {We present PYHESSIAN, a new scalable framework that enables fast computation of Hessian (i.e., second-order derivative) information for deep neural networks. PYHESSIAN enables fast computations of the top Hessian eigenvalues, the Hessian trace, and the full Hessian eigenvalue/spectral density, and it supports distributed-memory execution on cloud/supercomputer systems and is available as open source [1]. This general framework can be used to analyze neural network models, including the topology of the loss landscape (i.e., curvature information) to gain insight into the behavior of different models/optimizers. To illustrate this, we analyze the effect of residual connections and Batch Normalization layers on the trainability of neural networks. One recent claim, based on simpler first-order analysis, is that residual connections and Batch Normalization make the loss landscape ``smoother'', thus making it easier for Stochastic Gradient Descent to converge to a good solution. Our extensive analysis shows new finer-scale insights, demonstrating that, while conventional wisdom is sometimes validated, in other cases it is simply incorrect. In particular, we find that Batch Normalization does not necessarily make the loss landscape smoother, especially for shallower networks.},

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4\,million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show~that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90\,kb, covering about 21\% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel               2               ) account for 40\% (45\%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10\textendash 20\% (14\textendash 24\%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Variation is rampant throughout human genomes: some of it affects disease risk, and most does not; to separate the two requires a plethora of hypothesis tests. This challenge of multiple testing\textemdash limiting false positives while maximizing power\textemdash arises in many ``omics'' studies and sciences. One approach is to control the false discovery rate (FDR), and a recent selective inference method for controlling FDR, adaptive               P               -value thresholding (AdaPT), facilitates incorporation of auxiliary information (covariates) related to each hypothesis test. How AdaPT performs on data is an open question. We apply AdaPT to results from genomic association studies and include many covariates. This adaptive search discovers a more complex and interpretable model with far greater power than classic multiple testing procedures.                        ,                             To correct for a large number of hypothesis tests, most researchers rely on simple multiple testing corrections. Yet, new methodologies of selective inference could potentially improve power while retaining statistical guarantees, especially those that enable exploration of test statistics using auxiliary information (covariates) to weight hypothesis tests for association. We explore one such method, adaptive               P               -value thresholding (AdaPT), in the framework of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression/coexpression studies, with particular emphasis on schizophrenia (SCZ). Selected SCZ GWAS association               P               values play the role of the primary data for AdaPT; single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are selected because they are gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). This natural pairing of SNPs and genes allow us to map the following covariate values to these pairs: GWAS statistics from genetically correlated bipolar disorder, the effect size of SNP genotypes on gene expression, and gene\textendash gene coexpression, captured by subnetwork (module) membership. In all, 24 covariates per SNP/gene pair were included in the AdaPT analysis using flexible gradient boosted trees. We demonstrate a substantial increase in power to detect SCZ associations using gene expression information from the developing human prefrontal cortex. We interpret these results in light of recent theories about the polygenic nature of SCZ. Importantly, our entire process for identifying enrichment and creating features with independent complementary data sources can be implemented in many different high-throughput settings to ultimately improve power.},

The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment.},

  abstract = {Significance             Comparative analysis of samples from two biological states, such as two stages of embryonic development, is a pressing problem in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). A key challenge is to detect cell subpopulations whose abundance differs between the two states. To that end, we develop DA-seq, a multiscale strategy to compare two cellular distributions. In contrast to existing unsupervised clustering-based analysis, DA-seq can delineate cell subpopulations with the most significant discrepancy between two states and potentially reveal important changes in cellular processes that are undetectable using conventional methods.           ,                             Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its               k               nearest neighboring cells across a range of               k               values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.},
