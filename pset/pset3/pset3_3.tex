Kipf and Welling approximate a filter of a graph signal $x$ in the spectral domain by 
$$
g_\theta \star x=U g_\theta U^{\top} x \approx \sum_{k=0}^K \theta_k^{\prime} T_k(\tilde{L}) x.
$$
Here $g_\theta$ is a diagonal matrix acting as a filter, $T_k$ is the Chebyshev polynomials of the $k-th$ order, and $\tilde{L}$ being a scaled and translated version of the graph Laplacian $L$. Since $T_k(\tilde{L})$ is a Kth-order polynomial in the Laplacian $L$, the expression only depends on nodes that are at maximum K steps away from the central nodes. Hence, the expression is K-localized. This is analogous to the convolutional layers of CNNs.    

Limitations of this approach include that memory requirement grows linearly in the number of edges.
